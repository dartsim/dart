# DART Simulation Verification

Load this skill when verifying that a DART 3D scene or physics simulation is
correct — implementing, debugging, benchmarking, or reviewing dynamics,
collision, contact, or GUI output. DART's domains need 3D understanding that
language models lack natively; this tooling makes it checkable without a GUI.

**Lead with text, corroborate with images.** Measured A/B evidence: per-step
metrics and trajectories detect nearly all seeded physics defects; a rendered
image alone misses static geometry defects (penetration, interpenetration).
Decide correctness from text; use images for scene comprehension and gross
dynamic failures.

## Full documentation

[`docs/onboarding/agent-sim-verification.md`](../../../docs/onboarding/agent-sim-verification.md)
— the durable guide. `docs/ai/verification.md` owns the gate policy;
`docs/onboarding/profiling.md` owns text-first profiling.

## Quick commands

Text (primary):

- `world.compute_step_metrics()` — energy/momentum/penetration/contacts/residual
- `dartpy.dump_scene_json(world)` / `dump_scene_text(world)` — "what is in this
  world?" (glTF/USD-flavored hierarchy + flat index)
- `pixi run scene-diff` — structural JSON verdict for intended-vs-actual scene
  dumps
- `pixi run trajectory-record` / `pixi run trajectory-compare` — per-body TSV +
  contact JSONL; bit-exact or tolerance diff with first-divergence

Visual (corroboration):

- `dart.gui.render(world, camera=None, size=(w, h))` → headless image;
  `.png_bytes()` for notebooks; `dart.gui.orbit_camera(...)` / `look_at(...)`
- viewer camera flags: `--view {three-quarter|front|side|top}`,
  `--camera-azimuth/-elevation/-distance/-target`, `--turntable N`, `--fit`
- `pixi run py-demo-capture` — headless PNG/MP4 capture from Python
- `pixi run image-verdict` / `image-golden` / `image-sheet` — JSON verdict,
  golden diff, contact sheet (contrast is report-only; `--require-contrast` to
  gate)
- `pixi run image-ab-study` — blind-judge detection deltas for single-view,
  multi-view, turntable, and annotated captures
- `pixi run image-ab-round2` — prepare a blinded round-2 packet and score
  completed judge observations

Opt-in:

- `pixi run render-golden-gate` — opt-in golden gate (backend-specific golden,
  curated locally with `-- --update`; not default CI)
- `pixi run rerun-trajectory` — rerun.io inspection (opt-in; graceful when
  `rerun-sdk` is absent)
- `pixi run verification-bundle` — package text evidence plus still/grid images
  for a provider-neutral VLM or reviewer call

Default capture for agent review: one ~1280 px frame, UI hidden, 3/4 view; add
a 9-frame grid for motion. Keep images as corroboration, never the sole oracle
for static geometry.

## DART 6 (release-6.20)

Equivalent capture over OpenSceneGraph: `dart::gui::osg::setUpOffscreenViewer`
/ `captureOffscreen` + dartpy bindings, `pixi run capture` (needs a real X
server or Xvfb), the ported image tooling, and `pixi run bm-boxes-headless` for
rendering-free determinism checksums.
