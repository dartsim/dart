"""Cycle smoke for the headless `dart-demos` Python runner (PLAN-103 Phase 1).

Asserts the registry has scenes, every scene can build and step a few frames
without crashing, and the runner's `--list` lists the catalog. The runner's
soft-fail path turns an unbuildable scene (e.g. a missing asset) into a logged
skip, so this test also passes when a robot URDF is unavailable; what we
guarantee is that the runner itself stays healthy.
