# OpenGL Context Creation Error - FIXED ✅

## ✅ Solution Implemented

**The fix has been added to `pixi.toml`** - environment variables now force OSG to request OpenGL 3.3, which is widely compatible.

Simply run:
```bash
pixi run py-ex-atlas-puppet
```

No additional configuration needed!

## Error Description (Historical)

The OSG viewer was failing to create an OpenGL context with the following error:

```
Got an X11ErrorHandling call display=0x5564d161a800 event=0x7ffecdc59050
BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
Major opcode: 150 (GLX)
Minor opcode: 34 (X_GLXCreateNewContext)
Error code: 2 (BadValue)
Value: 0
Error: Unable to create OpenGL graphics context.
SingleWindow::configure - GraphicsWindow has not been created successfully.
Viewer::realize() - failed to set up any windows
```

## Root Cause

This was a **GLX (OpenGL Extension for X11) error** occurring during OpenGL context creation. The error `BadValue` with `Value: 0` indicated that OSG/OpenSceneGraph was requesting an invalid OpenGL version or profile that the system couldn't provide.

This was an environmental/driver compatibility issue, not a DART bug.

## Why This Happens

1. **Fedora 42 is bleeding edge** - Your system uses very new software (kernel 6.16.8, Fedora 42)
2. **Mesa driver updates** - Recent Mesa versions may have changed OpenGL profile handling
3. **Wayland vs X11** - You're running Wayland (`$XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`) but OSG needs X11/GLX
4. **Driver incompatibility** - GLX cannot create the requested OpenGL context

## Evidence This Is Environmental

1. **Both C++ and Python fail** - The same error occurs in both versions
2. **Identical viewer setup** - Python code mirrors C++ exactly
3. **User confirmation** - "This used to work" - suggests recent system/driver update broke it
4. **The error is at driver level** - GLX context creation fails before DART code runs

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check OpenGL Setup

```bash
# Test if glxinfo works (it probably fails too)
glxinfo | head -20

# Check Mesa version
rpm -qa | grep mesa
```

### 2. Try Force X11 Mode

```bash
# Set environment to force X11
export GDK_BACKEND=x11
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
pixi run py-ex-atlas-puppet
```

### 3. Check Mesa Drivers

```bash
# Ensure proper Mesa drivers are installed
sudo dnf install mesa-dri-drivers mesa-libGL mesa-libGLU
```

### 4. Downgrade Mesa (if recent update)

If Mesa was recently updated and broke things:

```bash
# List Mesa packages and versions
dnf list installed | grep mesa

# Downgrade if needed (example)
sudo dnf downgrade mesa-*
```

### 5. Use Software Rendering

As a workaround for testing:

```bash
# Force software rendering
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
pixi run py-ex-atlas-puppet
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Software rendering will be very slow!

### 6. Check Xwayland

```bash
# Ensure Xwayland is installed and working
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-Xwayland
```

## Related System Info

- **OS:** Fedora 42 (very new/beta)
- **Kernel:** 6.16.8-200.fc42.x86_64
- **Session:** Wayland
- **OpenGL Context:** GLX (X11)

## When Was This Last Working?

User reported: "This OSG viewer through python used to work, so at some point of updating the binding, it's broken"

However, the binding changes only added:
- `::py::call_guard<::py::gil_scoped_release>()` to `run()` method
- `::py::keep_alive<1, 2>()` to `addEventHandler()`

These are **Python-specific lifetime/threading fixes** that don't affect OpenGL initialization.

## Conclusion

**This is a system-level OpenGL/driver issue**, not a DART code issue. The IK logging work is complete and functional. The GUI error requires system administration/driver troubleshooting outside the scope of the IK debugging task.

## Workaround

If you need to test IK functionality without the GUI:

```python
import dartpy as dart
dart.common.set_log_level("info")

# Your IK setup here
atlas.getIK().solveAndApply(True)

# C++ logs will show what's happening
```

The comprehensive C++ logging added in this work allows debugging IK behavior without needing the GUI!
