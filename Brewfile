# Homebrew dependencies for building DART on macOS
#
# NOTE: If you're using pixi, you don't need this file!
# Pixi manages all dependencies automatically via pixi.toml
#
# This Brewfile is for users who want to build DART manually
# without pixi using Homebrew packages.
#
# Usage:
#   brew bundle
#
# For pixi users, instead run:
#   pixi install
#   pixi run build
