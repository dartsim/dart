# `free_joint_cases`

Visualizes multiple `dart::dynamics::FreeJoint` single-body scenarios in a zero-gravity world.

Run from a build tree:

```sh
./free_joint_cases
```

Controls are available in the ImGui window for toggling simulation, resetting the cases, and running numeric checks (analytic vs. finite-difference Jacobians).
