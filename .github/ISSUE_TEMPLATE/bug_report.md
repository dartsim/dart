### Bug Report
> Please answer the following questions for yourself before reporting a bug.
- [ ] I checked the [documentation](http://dartsim.github.io/) and the [forum](https://dartsim.discourse.group/) but found no answer.
- [ ] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed.

#### Environment

> `$ make VERBOSE=1`
> and then dump the results into a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and share the link to gist here.
