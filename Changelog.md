### Version 3.0 (2013-11-04)

1. Removed Transformation classes. Their functionality is now included in joint classes.

1. Removed kinematics namespace. Functionality is moved to dynamics classes.
1. Added dart root namespace
1. A lot of function and variable renames
1. Added constraint namespace
1. Added "common" namespace

### Version 2.6 (2013-09-07)

  * Renamed DART_INCLUDEDIR to the standard-compliant DART_INCLUDE_DIRS in CMake files. Users need to adapt their CMake files for this change.
  * Users no longer need to call find_package(DARTExt) in the CMake files. A call to find_package(DART) also finds its dependencies now.
  * Allow user to overwrite installation prefix
  * Add possibility to include DART header files as '#include \<dart/dynamics/Skeleton.h\>' in addition to '#include \<dynamics/Skeleton.h\>'
  * Allow out-of-source builds
1. URDF loader:
  * Major clean-up
  * Consider mesh scaling factor

### Version 2.4 (2013-03-05)

1. Mass and inertia are no longer stored in Shape but in BodyNode.
1. Different shapes for collision and visualization (not just different meshes)
1. Shapes are no longer centered at the COM but can be transformed independently relative to the link frame.
1. Improved URDF support
  * Support for non-mesh shapes
  * Does not create dummy root nodes anymore
  * Support for continuous joints
  * Support for arbitrary joint axes for revolute joints (but not for prismatic joints) instead of only axis-aligned joint axes
  * Support for relative mesh paths even if the robot and world URDF files are in different directories
  * All supported joint types can be root joints
1. Clean-up of the Robot class
1. Removed Object class
1. More robust build and installation process on Linux
