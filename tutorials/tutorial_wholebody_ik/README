# Whole-Body Inverse Kinematics Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use whole-body inverse kinematics (IK) to control a humanoid robot's posture.

## Learning Objectives

1. Load and configure a complex humanoid robot (Atlas)
2. Create end effectors for robot limbs (hands, feet)
3. Set up IK targets and constraints
4. Use whole-body IK to achieve desired poses
5. Understand the importance of proper error method bounds

## Key Concepts

### What is Whole-Body IK?

Whole-body IK allows you to control the pose of a complex robot by specifying desired positions for its end effectors (hands, feet, etc.). The IK solver automatically computes the joint angles needed to achieve those positions while considering:

- Joint limits
- Collision avoidance
- Multiple simultaneous constraints
- Full body coordination

### Critical: Error Method Bounds

The tutorial highlights an important detail about DART's IK system:

**You must set tight bounds on the error method for position tracking!**

```cpp
ik->getErrorMethod().setBounds(
    Eigen::Vector6d::Constant(-1e-8),
    Eigen::Vector6d::Constant(1e-8));
```

Why? The `TaskSpaceRegion` error method only computes non-zero error when the displacement is *outside* the specified bounds. With infinite bounds (the default), any displacement is "within bounds", producing zero error and zero gradient. This prevents the optimizer from finding the solution.

## Interactive Features

- **Drag and drop**: Click and drag the colored spheres at the end effectors to move them
- **Real-time IK**: Watch the robot adjust its whole-body posture to reach the targets
- **Reset pose**: Press 'R' to return to the standing configuration

## Running the Tutorial

```bash
# Build the tutorial
pixi run build

# Run the tutorial
./build/default/cpp/Release/bin/tutorial_wholebody_ik
```

## What You'll See

When you run the tutorial:

1. The Atlas robot loads in a standing pose
2. Colored spheres appear at the hand positions (end effectors)
3. You can drag these spheres to new positions
4. The robot's entire body adjusts to reach the new hand positions
5. Joint limits and constraints are automatically respected

## Extending the Tutorial

Try adding:

- Foot end effectors for balancing
- COM (Center of Mass) constraints
- Joint angle preferences
- Obstacle avoidance
- Multiple priority levels (hierarchical IK)
