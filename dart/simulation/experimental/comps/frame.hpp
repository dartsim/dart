/// Tag marking entity as a Frame
///
/// A Frame is anything with a spatial location and orientation that can
/// participate in kinematic queries (transform, velocity, acceleration).
/// Frames form a tree hierarchy through parent-child relationships.
///
/// Entities with FrameTag can be:
/// - Links (most common - rigid bodies in articulated systems)
/// - Joints (origin/axis frames)
/// - SimpleFrames (user-defined frames with fixed offset from parent)
/// - ShapeFrames (attached to collision/visual shapes)
/// - World frame (root of all frame hierarchies)
///
/// **Internal Implementation Detail** - Not exposed in public API
