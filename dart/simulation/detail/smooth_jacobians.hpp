// Implementation-detail header for opt-in differentiable simulation (PLAN-110
// WS1). It is NOT a public facade header: it takes ECS/registry and component
// types, which must never appear in a public signature. It lives under
// `detail/` so Doxygen and the API-boundary checks treat it as internal, and it
// is not part of the DART 7 public-facade promotion target. In-tree tests may
// include it directly.

/// (recovering the classic blocks). For Spherical joints the rotation vector
/// integrates as q' = Log(Exp(q) · Exp(q̇' Δt)), giving the SO(3) right-Jacobian
/// blocks (dexp/dlog); for Floating joints the same SO(3) blocks apply to the
/// orientation coordinates plus a translation-vs-orientation coupling block
/// (the parent-frame translation update R(orientation) · q̇'_lin Δt). These
/// differentiate the EXACT manifold integration used by `simulateMultibody`.
///
/// The articulated derivatives `∂M/∂q_k`, `∂c/∂q_k`, and `∂c/∂q̇_k` are obtained
/// by CENTRAL finite differencing `computeMultibodyDynamicsTerms` with respect
/// to the registry's joint positions and velocities. The joint state is
/// perturbed in place, the terms recomputed, and the state restored exactly,
/// leaving the registry unchanged on return. This finite-difference-of-terms is
/// distinct from the finite-difference-of-step used by the correctness checker.
