/*

given (A,b,lo,hi), solve the LCP problem: A*x = b+w, where each x(i),w(i)
satisfies one of
	(1) x = lo, w >= 0
	(2) x = hi, w <= 0
	(3) lo < x < hi, w = 0
A is a matrix of dimension n*n, everything else is a vector of size n*1.
lo and hi can be +/- dInfinity as needed. the first `nub' variables are
unbounded, i.e. hi and lo are assumed to be +/- dInfinity.

we restrict lo(i) <= 0 and hi(i) >= 0.

the original data (A,b) may be modified by this function.

if the `findex' (friction index) parameter is nonzero, it points to an array
of index values. in this case constraints that have findex[i] >= 0 are
special. all non-special constraints are solved for, then the lo and hi values
for the special constraints are set:
  hi[i] = abs( hi[i] * x[findex[i]] )
  lo[i] = -hi[i]
and the solution continues. this mechanism allows a friction approximation
to be implemented. the first `nub' variables are assumed to have findex < 0.
