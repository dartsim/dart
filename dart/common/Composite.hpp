/// is given. Aspects are stored in a std::map, so access to its Aspects happens
/// on average in log(N) time. Most often, a class that accepts Aspects will have
/// certain Aspect types that it will need to access frequently, and it would be
/// beneficial to have constant-time access to those Aspect types. To get
/// constant-time access to specific Aspect types, you can use the templated
