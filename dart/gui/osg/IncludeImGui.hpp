// ImGui header inclusion handling for different configurations
//
// When DART_USE_SYSTEM_IMGUI=OFF:
//   - Build tree: ImGui fetched via FetchContent, headers in
//   build/_deps/imgui-src
//   - Install tree: Headers installed to include/ and include/backends/
//   - Include directories configured in cmake/DARTFindDependencies.cmake
//
// When DART_USE_SYSTEM_IMGUI=ON:
//   - Package managers install ImGui in different locations:
//     * conda-forge: include/imgui.h, include/imgui_impl_opengl2.h
//     * vcpkg: include/imgui.h, include/imgui/backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h
//     * apt (varies): include/imgui/imgui.h,
//     include/imgui/backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h
//   - cmake/Findimgui.cmake handles these variations and adds proper include
//   paths
//
// Both configurations end up with compatible include paths, so we try standard
// patterns in order of preference:
#if __has_include(<imgui.h>)
  #include <imgui.h>
#elif __has_include(<imgui/imgui.h>)
  #include <imgui/imgui.h>
#else
  #error "Could not find imgui.h - check your ImGui installation"
#endif

#if __has_include(<imgui_impl_opengl2.h>)
  #include <imgui_impl_opengl2.h>
#elif __has_include(<backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h>)
  #include <backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h>
#elif __has_include(<imgui/backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h>)
  #include <imgui/backends/imgui_impl_opengl2.h>
