Changes since the last public release (1.4.4):

  Fixed possible configure.ac bug introduced in version 1.4.4.
  Wrapped long lines in CMakeLists.txt and introduced ${libpng_public_hdrs}
  Check for out-of-range text compression mode in png_set_text().
  Removed some extraneous parentheses that appeared in pngrutil.c of
    libpng-1.4.3
  Revised png_get_uint_32, png_get_int_32, png_get_uint_16 (Cosmin)
  Moved reading of file signature into png_read_sig (Cosmin)
  Fixed atomicity of chunk header serialization (Cosmin)
  Added test for io_state in pngtest.c (Cosmin)
  Added "#!/bin/sh" at the top of contrib/pngminim/*/gather.sh scripts.
  Changes to remove gcc warnings (John Bowler)
    Certain optional gcc warning flags resulted in warnings in libpng code.
    With these changes only -Wconversion and -Wcast-qual cannot be turned on.
    Changes are trivial rearrangements of code.  -Wconversion is not possible
    for pngrutil.c (because of the widespread use of += et al on variables
    smaller than (int) or (unsigned int)) and -Wcast-qual is not possible
    with pngwio.c and pngwutil.c because the 'write' callback and zlib
    compression both fail to declare their input buffers with 'const'.
  Added comment about the potential API incompatibility of the
    png_get_uint_16() macro with libpng-1.4.0 through 1.4.4.
  Removed PNG_NO_WRITE_GAMMA from pngminim/encoder/pngusr.h
