version 0.81 [August, 1995]
  incorporated Tim Wegner's medium model code (thanks, Tim)

version 0.82 [September, 1995]
  [unspecified changes]

version 0.85 [December, 1995]
  added more medium model code (almost everything's a far)
  added i/o, error, and memory callback functions
  fixed some bugs (16 bit, 4 bit interlaced, etc.)
  added first run progressive reader (barely tested)

version 0.86 [January, 1996]
  fixed bugs
  improved documentation

version 0.87 [January, 1996]
  fixed medium model bugs
  fixed other bugs introduced in 0.85 and 0.86
  added some minor documentation

version 0.88 [January, 1996]
  fixed progressive bugs
  replaced tabs with spaces
  cleaned up documentation
  added callbacks for read/write and warning/error functions

version 0.89 [July, 1996]
  added new initialization API to make libpng work better with shared libs
     we now have png_create_read_struct(), png_create_write_struct(),
     png_create_info_struct(), png_destroy_read_struct(), and
     png_destroy_write_struct() instead of the separate calls to
     malloc and png_read_init(), png_info_init(), and png_write_init()
  changed warning/error callback functions to fix bug - this means you
     should use the new initialization API if you were using the old
     png_set_message_fn() calls, and that the old API no longer exists
     so that people are aware that they need to change their code
  changed filter selection API to allow selection of multiple filters
     since it didn't work in previous versions of libpng anyways
  optimized filter selection code
  fixed png_set_background() to allow using an arbitrary RGB color for
     paletted images
  fixed gamma and background correction for paletted images, so
     png_correct_palette is not needed unless you are correcting an
     external palette (you will need to #define PNG_CORRECT_PALETTE_SUPPORTED
     in pngconf.h) - if nobody uses this, it may disappear in the future.
  fixed bug with Borland 64K memory allocation (Alexander Lehmann)
  fixed bug in interlace handling (Smarasderagd, I think)
  added more error checking for writing and image to reduce invalid files
  separated read and write functions so that they won't both be linked
     into a binary when only reading or writing functionality is used
  new pngtest image also has interlacing and zTXt
  updated documentation to reflect new API

version 0.90 [January, 1997]
  made CRC errors/warnings on critical and ancillary chunks configurable
  libpng will use the zlib CRC routines by (compile-time) default
  changed DOS small/medium model memory support - needs zlib 1.04 (Tim Wegner)
  added external C++ wrapper statements to png.h (Gilles Dauphin)
  allow PNG file to be read when some or all of file signature has already
     been read from the beginning of the stream.  ****This affects the size
     of info_struct and invalidates all programs that use a shared libpng****
  fixed png_filler() declarations
  fixed? background color conversions
  fixed order of error function pointers to match documentation
  current chunk name is now available in png_struct to reduce the number
     of nearly identical error messages (will simplify multi-lingual
     support when available)
  try to get ready for unknown-chunk callback functions:
     - previously read critical chunks are flagged, so the chunk handling
       routines can determine if the chunk is in the right place
     - all chunk handling routines have the same prototypes, so we will
       be able to handle all chunks via a callback mechanism
  try to fix Linux "setjmp" buffer size problems
  removed png_large_malloc, png_large_free, and png_realloc functions.

version 0.95 [March, 1997]
  fixed bug in pngwutil.c allocating "up_row" twice and "avg_row" never
  fixed bug in PNG file signature compares when start != 0
  changed parameter type of png_set_filler(...filler...) from png_byte
     to png_uint_32
  added test for MACOS to ensure that both math.h and fp.h are not #included
  added macros for libpng to be compiled as a Windows DLL (Andreas Kupries)
  added "packswap" transformation, which changes the endianness of
     packed-pixel bytes (Kevin Bracey)
  added "strip_alpha" transformation, which removes the alpha channel of
     input images without using it (not necessarily a good idea)
  added "swap_alpha" transformation, which puts the alpha channel in front
     of the color bytes instead of after
  removed all implicit variable tests which assume NULL == 0 (I think)
  changed several variables to "png_size_t" to show 16/32-bit limitations
  added new pCAL chunk read/write support
  added experimental filter selection weighting (Greg Roelofs)
  removed old png_set_rgbx() and png_set_xrgb() functions that have been
     obsolete for about 2 years now (use png_set_filler() instead)
  added macros to read 16- and 32-bit ints directly from buffer, to be
     used only on those systems that support it (namely PowerPC and 680x0)
     With some testing, this may become the default for MACOS/PPC systems.
  only calculate CRC on data if we are going to use it
  added macros for zTXt compression type PNG_zTXt_COMPRESSION_???
  added macros for simple libpng debugging output selectable at compile time
  removed PNG_READ_END_MODE in progressive reader (Smarasderagd)
  more description of info_struct in libpng.txt and png.h
  more instructions in example.c
  more chunk types tested in pngtest.c
  renamed pngrcb.c to pngset.c, and all png_read_<chunk> functions to be
     png_set_<chunk>.  We now have corresponding png_get_<chunk>
     functions in pngget.c to get information in info_ptr.  This isolates
     the application from the internal organization of png_info_struct
     (good for shared library implementations).

  added more typecasts. 65536L becomes (png_uint_32)65536L, etc. (Glenn R-P)
  minor corrections in libpng.txt
  added simple sRGB support (Glenn R-P)
  easier conditional compiling, e.g. define PNG_READ/WRITE_NOT_FULLY_SUPPORTED;
     all configurable options can be selected from command-line instead
     of having to edit pngconf.h (Glenn R-P)
  fixed memory leak in pngwrite.c (free info_ptr->text) (Glenn R-P)
  added more conditions for png_do_background, to avoid changing
     black pixels to background when a background is supplied and
     no pixels are transparent
  repaired PNG_NO_STDIO behaviour
  tested NODIV support and made it default behaviour (Greg Roelofs)
  added "-m" option and PNGTEST_DEBUG_MEMORY to pngtest (John Bowler)
  regularized version numbering scheme and bumped shared-library major
     version number to 2 to avoid problems with libpng 0.89 apps (Greg Roelofs)

  cleaned up some typos in libpng.txt and in code documentation
  fixed memory leaks in pCAL chunk processing (Glenn R-P and John Bowler)
  cosmetic change "display_gamma" to "screen_gamma" in pngrtran.c
  changed recommendation about file_gamma for PC images to .51 from .45,
     in example.c and libpng.txt, added comments to distinguish between
     screen_gamma, viewing_gamma, and display_gamma.
  changed all references to RFC1152 to read RFC1123 and changed the
     PNG_TIME_RFC1152_SUPPORTED macro to PNG_TIME_RFC1123_SUPPORTED
  added png_invert_alpha capability (Glenn R-P -- suggestion by Jon Vincent)
  changed srgb_intent from png_byte to int to avoid compiler bugs

version 0.99 [January 30, 1998]
  free info_ptr->text instead of end_info_ptr->text in pngread.c (John Bowler)
  fixed a longstanding "packswap" bug in pngtrans.c
  fixed some inconsistencies in pngconf.h that prevented compiling with
     PNG_READ_GAMMA_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_hIST_SUPPORTED undefined
  fixed some typos and made other minor rearrangement of libpng.txt (Andreas)
  changed recommendation about file_gamma for PC images to .50 from .51 in
     example.c and libpng.txt, and changed file_gamma for sRGB images to .45

    in pngtest.c (Duncan Simpson).
  Fixed a bug in pngtest.c that caused pngtest to try to write a tIME chunk
    even when no tIME chunk was present in the source file.
  Fixed a problem in pngrutil.c: gray_to_rgb didn't always work with 16-bit.
  Fixed a problem in png_read_push_finish_row(), which would not skip some
    passes that it should skip, for images that are less than 3 pixels high.
  Interchanged the order of calls to png_do_swap() and png_do_shift()
    in pngwtran.c (John Cromer).

  Corrected the typedef for png_free_ptr in png.h (Jesse Jones).
  Correct gamma with srgb is 45455 instead of 45000 in pngrutil.c, to be
    consistent with PNG-1.2, and allow variance of 500 before complaining.
  Added assembler code contributed by Intel in file pngvcrd.c and modified

  Relocated start of 'extern "C"' block in png.h so it doesn't include pngconf.h
  Revised calculation of num_blocks in pngmem.c to avoid a potentially
    negative shift distance, whose results are undefined in the C language.

  Fixed a typo in the png_set_sRGB() function call in example.c (Jan Nijtmans)
  Further optimization and bugfix of pngvcrd.c
  Revised pngset.c so that it does not allocate or free memory in the user's
    text_ptr structure.  Instead, it makes its own copy.
  Created separate write_end_info_struct in pngtest.c for a more severe test.
  Added code in pngwrite.c to free info_ptr->text[i].key to stop a memory leak.
version 1.0.5b [November 23, 1999]

    eliminated use of png_sig in pngwutil.c.  Moved the various png_CHNK arrays
    into pngtypes.h.  Eliminated use of global png_pass arrays.  Declared the
    png_CHNK and png_pass arrays to be "const".  Made the global arrays
    available to applications (although none are used in libpng itself) when
    PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is not defined or when PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Removed some extraneous "-I" from contrib/pngminus/makefile.std
  Changed the PNG_sRGB_INTENT macros in png.h to be consistent with PNG-1.2.
  Change PNG_SRGB_INTENT to PNG_sRGB_INTENT in libpng.txt and libpng.3
version 1.0.5d [November 29, 1999]
  Add type cast (png_const_charp) two places in png.c
  Eliminated pngtypes.h; use macros instead to declare PNG_CHNK arrays.

  comment out (with #ifdef) all the new declarations when
    PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Added PNG_EXPORT_VAR macro to accommodate making DLL's.
version 1.0.5e [November 30, 1999]
  Added iCCP, iTXt, and sPLT support; added "lang" member to the png_text
    structure; refactored the inflate/deflate support to make adding new chunks
    with trailing compressed parts easier in the future, and added new functions
    png_free_iCCP, png_free_pCAL, png_free_sPLT, png_free_text, png_get_iCCP,
    png_get_spalettes, png_set_iCCP, png_set_spalettes (Eric S. Raymond).
  NOTE: Applications that write text chunks MUST define png_text->lang
    before calling png_set_text(). It must be set to NULL if you want to
    write tEXt or zTXt chunks.  If you want your application to be able to
    run with older versions of libpng, use

      #ifdef PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED
         png_text[i].lang = NULL;
      #endif

  Changed png_get_oFFs() and png_set_oFFs() to use signed rather than unsigned
    offsets (Eric S. Raymond).
  Combined PNG_READ_cHNK_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_cHNK_SUPPORTED macros into
    PNG_cHNK_SUPPORTED and combined the three types of PNG_text_SUPPORTED
    macros, leaving the separate macros also available.
  Removed comments on #endifs at the end of many short, non-nested #if-blocks.
version 1.0.5f [December 6, 1999]

  Added code to handle new chunks in pngpread.c
  Moved PNG_CHNK string macro definitions outside of PNG_NO_EXTERN block
  Added "translated_key" to png_text structure and png_write_iTXt().
  Added code in pngwrite.c to work around a newly discovered zlib bug.
version 1.0.5h [December 10, 1999]
  NOTE: regarding the note for version 1.0.5e, the following must also
    be included in your code:
        png_text[i].translated_key = NULL;
  Unknown chunk handling is now supported.
  Option to eliminate all floating point support was added.  Some new
    fixed-point functions such as png_set_gAMA_fixed() were added.
  Expanded tabs and removed trailing blanks in source files.
version 1.0.5i [December 13, 1999]
  Added some type casts to silence compiler warnings.

  Added a test for up->location != 0 in the first instance of writing
    unknown chunks in pngwrite.c
  Changed "num" to "i" in png_free_spalettes() and png_free_unknowns() to
    prevent recursion.
  Added png_free_hIST() function.
  Various patches to fix bugs in the sCAL and integer cHRM processing,
    and to add some convenience macros for use with sCAL.
version 1.0.5j [December 21, 1999]
  Changed "unit" parameter of png_write_sCAL from png_byte to int, to work
    around buggy compilers.
  Added new type "png_fixed_point" for integers that hold float*100000 values
  Restored backward compatibility of tEXt/zTXt chunk processing:
    Restored the first four members of png_text to the same order as v.1.0.5d.
    Added members "lang_key" and "itxt_length" to png_text struct.  Set
    text_length=0 when "text" contains iTXt data.  Use the "compression"
    member to distinguish among tEXt/zTXt/iTXt types.  Added
    PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_NONE (1) and PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt(2) macros.
    The "Note" above, about backward incompatibility of libpng-1.0.5e, no
    longer applies.
  Fixed png_read|write_iTXt() to read|write parameters in the right order,
    and to write the iTXt chunk after IDAT if it appears in the end_ptr.
  Added pnggccrd.c, version of pngvcrd.c Intel assembler for gcc (Greg Roelofs)
  Reversed the order of trying to write floating-point and fixed-point gAMA.
version 1.0.5k [December 27, 1999]

  Added png_handle_as_unknown() function (Glenn)
  Added png_free_chunk_list() function and chunk_list and num_chunk_list members
    of png_ptr.
  Eliminated erroneous warnings about multiple sPLT chunks and sPLT-after-PLTE.
  Fixed a libpng-1.0.5h bug in pngrutil.c that was issuing erroneous warnings
    about ignoring incorrect gAMA with sRGB (gAMA was in fact not ignored)

version 1.0.5l [January 1, 2000]
  Added functions png_set_read_user_chunk_fn() and png_get_user_chunk_ptr()
    for setting a callback function to handle unknown chunks and for
    retrieving the associated user pointer (Glenn).
version 1.0.5m [January 7, 2000]
  Added high-level functions png_read_png(), png_write_png(), png_free_pixels().
version 1.0.5n [January 9, 2000]
  Added png_free_PLTE() function, and modified png_set_PLTE() to malloc its
    own memory for info_ptr->palette.  This makes it safe for the calling
    application to free its copy of the palette any time after it calls
    png_set_PLTE().
version 1.0.5o [January 20, 2000]
  Cosmetic changes only (removed some trailing blanks and TABs)
version 1.0.5p [January 31, 2000]
  Renamed pngdll.mak to makefile.bd32

  Fixed a bug in pngrtran.c that improperly expanded the background color.
  Return *num_text=0 from png_get_text() when appropriate, and fix documentation
    of png_get_text() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
version 1.0.5s [February 18, 2000]
  Added "png_jmp_env()" macro to pngconf.h, to help people migrate to the
    new error handler that's planned for the next libpng release, and changed
    example.c, pngtest.c, and contrib programs to use this macro.
  Revised some of the DLL-export macros in pngconf.h (Greg Roelofs)
  Fixed a bug in png_read_png() that caused it to fail to expand some images
    that it should have expanded.
  Fixed some mistakes in the unused and undocumented INCH_CONVERSIONS functions
    in pngget.c
  Changed the allocation of palette, history, and trans arrays back to
    the version 1.0.5 method (linking instead of copying) which restores
    backward compatibility with version 1.0.5.  Added some remarks about
    that in example.c.  Added "free_me" member to info_ptr and png_ptr
    and added png_free_data() function.
  Updated makefile.linux and makefile.gccmmx to make directories conditionally.

  Changed png_jmp_env() migration aiding macro to png_jmpbuf().
  Fixed "interlace" typo (should be "interlaced") in contrib/gregbook/read2-x.c
  Fixed bug with use of PNG_BEFORE_IHDR bit in png_ptr->mode, introduced when
    PNG_FLAG_HAVE_CHUNK_HEADER was moved into png_ptr->mode in version 1.0.5b
  Files in contrib/gregbook were revised to use png_jmpbuf() and to select
    a 24-bit visual if one is available, and to allow abbreviated options.
  Files in contrib/pngminus were revised to use the png_jmpbuf() macro.
  Removed spaces in makefile.linux and makefile.gcmmx, introduced in 1.0.5s
version 1.0.5u [March 5, 2000]

  Added some parentheses to the png_jmpbuf macro definition.
  Updated references to the zlib home page, which has moved to freesoftware.com.
  Corrected bugs in documentation regarding png_read_row() and png_write_row().

  Minor revisions of makefile.bor, libpng.txt, and gregbook/rpng2-win.c
  Added makefile.sggcc (SGI IRIX with gcc)

version 1.0.6e [April 9, 2000]
  Added png_data_freer() function.
  In the code that checks for over-length tRNS chunks, added check of
    info_ptr->num_trans as well as png_ptr->num_trans (Matthias Benckmann)
  Minor revisions of libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Check for existing data and free it if the free_me flag is set, in png_set_*()
    and png_handle_*().
  Only define PNG_WEIGHTED_FILTERS_SUPPORTED when PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Changed several instances of PNG_NO_CONSOLE_ID to PNG_NO_STDIO in pngrutil.c
    and mentioned the purposes of the two macros in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
version 1.0.6f [April 14, 2000]
  Revised png_set_iCCP() and png_set_rows() to avoid prematurely freeing data.
  Add checks in png_set_text() for NULL members of the input text structure.
  Revised libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Removed superfluous prototype for png_set_itxt from png.h
  Removed "else" from pngread.c, after png_error(), and changed "0" to "length".

  Added png_pass-* arrays to pnggccrd.c when PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Relocated paragraph about png_set_background() in libpng.3/libpng.txt
    and other revisions (Matthias Benckmann)
  Relocated info_ptr->free_me, png_ptr->free_me, and other info_ptr and
    png_ptr members to restore binary compatibility with libpng-1.0.5
    (breaks compatibility with libpng-1.0.6).
version 1.0.6h [April 24, 2000]
  Changed shared library so-number pattern from 2.x.y.z to xy.z (this builds
    libpng.so.10 & libpng.so.10.6h instead of libpng.so.2 & libpng.so.2.1.0.6h)
    This is a temporary change for test purposes.
version 1.0.6i [May 2, 2000]
  Rearranged some members at the end of png_info and png_struct, to put
    unknown_chunks_num and free_me within the original size of the png_structs
    and free_me, png_read_user_fn, and png_free_fn within the original png_info,
    because some old applications allocate the structs directly instead of
    using png_create_*().
  Added documentation of user memory functions in libpng.txt/libpng.3
  Modified png_read_png so that it will use user_allocated row_pointers
    if present, unless free_me directs that it be freed, and added description
    of the use of png_set_rows() and png_get_rows() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Added PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED macro, and #ifdef out all new (since version
    1.00) members of png_struct and png_info, to regain binary compatibility
    when you define this macro.  Capabilities lost in this event
    are user transforms (new in version 1.0.0),the user transform pointer
    (new in version 1.0.2), rgb_to_gray (new in 1.0.5), iCCP, sCAL, sPLT,
    the high-level interface, and unknown chunks support (all new in 1.0.6).
    This was necessary because of old applications that allocate the structs
    directly as authors were instructed to do in libpng-0.88 and earlier,
    instead of using png_create_*().
  Added modes PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT which
    can be used to detect codes that directly allocate the structs, and
    code to check these modes in png_read_init() and png_write_init() and
    generate a libpng error if the modes aren't set and PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED
    was not defined.
  Added makefile.intel and updated makefile.watcom (Pawel Mrochen)
version 1.0.6j [May 3, 2000]
  Overloaded png_read_init() and png_write_init() with macros that convert
    calls to png_read_init_2() or png_write_init_2() that check the version
    and structure sizes.
version 1.0.7beta11 [May 7, 2000]
  Removed the new PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT modes
    which are no longer used.
  Eliminated the three new members of png_text when PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED is
    defined or when neither PNG_READ_iTXt_SUPPORTED nor PNG_WRITE_iTXT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Made PNG_NO_READ|WRITE_iTXt the default setting, to avoid memory
    overrun when old applications fill the info_ptr->text structure directly.
  Added PNGAPI macro, and added it to the definitions of all exported functions.
  Relocated version macro definitions ahead of the includes of zlib.h and
    pngconf.h in png.h.
version 1.0.7beta12 [May 12, 2000]
  Revised pngset.c to avoid a problem with expanding the png_debug macro.
  Deleted some extraneous defines from pngconf.h
  Made PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO the default condition when PNG_BUILD_DLL is defined.
  Use MSC _RPTn debugging instead of fprintf if _MSC_VER is defined.
  Added png_access_version_number() function.
  Check for mask&PNG_FREE_CHNK (for TEXT, SCAL, PCAL) in png_free_data().
  Expanded libpng.3/libpng.txt information about png_data_freer().
version 1.0.7beta14 [May 17, 2000] (beta13 was not published)
  Changed pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c to handle bad adaptive filter types as
    warnings instead of errors, as pngrutil.c does.
  Set the PNG_INFO_IDAT valid flag in png_set_rows() so png_write_png()
    will actually write IDATs.
  Made the default PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS depend on PNG_DLL instead of WIN32.
  Make png_free_data() ignore its final parameter except when freeing data
    that can have multiple instances (text, sPLT, unknowns).
  Fixed a new bug in png_set_rows().
  Removed info_ptr->valid tests from png_free_data(), as in version 1.0.5.
  Added png_set_invalid() function.
  Fixed incorrect illustrations of png_destroy_write_struct() in example.c.
version 1.0.7beta15 [May 30, 2000]
  Revised the deliberately erroneous Linux setjmp code in pngconf.h to produce
    fewer error messages.
  Rearranged checks for Z_OK to check the most likely path first in pngpread.c
    and pngwutil.c.
  Added checks in pngtest.c for png_create_*() returning NULL, and mentioned
    in libpng.txt/libpng.3 the need for applications to check this.
  Changed names of png_default_*() functions in pngtest to pngtest_*().
  Changed return type of png_get_x|y_offset_*() from png_uint_32 to png_int_32.
  Fixed some bugs in the unused PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS functions in pngget.c
  Set each pointer to NULL after freeing it in png_free_data().
  Worked around a problem in pngconf.h; AIX's strings.h defines an "index"
    macro that conflicts with libpng's png_color_16.index. (Dimitri Papadapoulos)
  Added "msvc" directory with MSVC++ project files (Simon-Pierre Cadieux).
version 1.0.7beta16 [June 4, 2000]
  Revised the workaround of AIX string.h "index" bug.
  Added a check for overlength PLTE chunk in pngrutil.c.
  Added PNG_NO_POINTER_INDEXING macro to use array-indexing instead of pointer
    indexing in pngrutil.c and pngwutil.c to accommodate a buggy compiler.
  Added a warning in png_decompress_chunk() when it runs out of data, e.g.
    when it tries to read an erroneous PhotoShop iCCP chunk.
  Added PNG_USE_DLL macro.
  Revised the copyright/disclaimer/license notice.
  Added contrib/msvctest directory
version 1.0.7rc1 [June 9, 2000]
  Corrected the definition of PNG_TRANSFORM_INVERT_ALPHA  (0x0400 not 0x0200)
  Added contrib/visupng directory (Willem van Schaik)
version 1.0.7beta18 [June 23, 2000]

    and do not redefine PNGAPI if it is passed in via a compiler directive.
  Revised visupng/PngFile.c to remove returns from within the Try block.
  Removed leading underscores from "_PNG_H" and "_PNG_SAVE_BSD_SOURCE" macros.
  Updated contrib/visupng/cexcept.h to version 1.0.0.

version 1.0.8beta1 [July 8, 2000]
  Added png_free(png_ptr, key) two places in pngpread.c to stop memory leaks.
  Changed PNG_NO_STDIO to PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO, several places in pngrutil.c and
     pngwutil.c.
  Changed PNG_EXPORT_VAR to use PNG_IMPEXP, in pngconf.h.
  Removed unused "#include <assert.h>" from png.c
  Added WindowsCE support.

    PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED, to make the png_set_keep mechanism
    available for ignoring known chunks even when not saving unknown chunks.

    png_struct or info_struct members and other deprecated usage in
    applications (John Bowler).
  Updated scripts/makefile* to add "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" to CFLAGS,
    to prevent warnings about direct access to png structs by libpng
    functions while building libpng.  They need to be tested, especially
    those using compilers other than gcc.
  Updated projects/visualc6 and visualc71 with "/d PNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG".
    They should work but still need to be updated to remove
    references to pnggccrd.c or pngvcrd.c and ASM building.
  Added README.txt to the beos, cbuilder5, netware, and xcode projects warning

  Fixed a typo in scripts/pngwin.def introduced in beta97.

version 1.4.0beta99 [November 14, 2009]
  Moved libpng-config.in and libpng.pc-configure.in out of the scripts
    directory, to libpng-config.in and libpng-pc.in, respectively, and
    modified Makefile.am and configure.ac accordingly.  Now "configure"

    to png_flush() after png_write_IEND().  See 1.4.0beta32, 1.4.0beta50
    changes above and 1.2.30, 1.2.30rc01 and rc03 in 1.2.41 CHANGES.  Someone
    needs this feature.
  Make the 'png_jmpbuf' macro expand to a call that records the correct
    longjmp function as well as returning a pointer to the setjmp

    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng14 instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng14.

version 1.4.0beta108 [December 11, 2009]
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c; the

version 1.4.5beta06 [November 21, 2010]
  Restored the parentheses in pngrutil.c; they are needed when the
    png_get_*int_*() functions are compiled (i.e., when PNG_USE_READ_MACROS
    is not defined).
  Make the "png_get_uint_16" macro return a png_uint_32 in libpng-1.4 for API
    compatibility.
  Changes to remove gcc warnings (John Bowler)
    Certain optional gcc warning flags resulted in warnings in libpng code.
    With these changes only -Wconversion and -Wcast-qual cannot be turned on.
    Changes are trivial rearrangements of code.  -Wconversion is not possible
    for pngrutil.c (because of the widespread use of += et al on variables
    smaller than (int) or (unsigned int)) and -Wcast-qual is not possible
    with pngwio.c and pngwutil.c because the 'write' callback and zlib
    compression both fail to declare their input buffers with 'const'.

  Reverted png_get_uint_16 macro to beta05 and added comment about the
    potential API incompatibility.
