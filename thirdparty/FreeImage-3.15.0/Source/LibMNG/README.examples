The samples are in platform-specific directories.

!!! contributions are very welcome !!!


bcb - Borland C++ Builder (3.0) (found under bcb/xxx)
-----------------------------------------------------

win32dll - sample project to create a Windows dll. Requires zlib1.2.1,
           IJG jpgsrc6b and lcms1.0.14. The directories containing these
           libraries must be at the same level as the libmng directory.
           So if you're in the directory with this file and the libmng
           sources, they should be in ..\zlib , ..\jpgsrc6b and ..\lcms
           respectively.

!!!        To run the other Win32 samples you need to copy the libmng.dll
           file from here into the sample's directory !!!

mngtree  - sample project to create a little command-line tool that dumps
           the chunk-structure of a given file onto stdout.

bogus    - a completely bogus example on how to create a perfectly valid
           (though slightly biased) MNG.

mngview  - port of the Delphi mngview sample. contributed by Andy Protano.
           see also README.contrib

mngrepair- an example on how to fix invalid MNG files
           uses the new mng_copy_chunks() function and MNG_SOFTERRORS to
           'ignore' certain input-errors. This conditional *MUST* only be used
           for exactly this kind of software; eg. repair utilities.


delphi - Borland Delphi (3.0+) (found under contrib/delphi/xxx)
---------------------------------------------------------------

mngview  - sample project for a simple mng-viewer. The general unit in
           the delphi directory was translated from libmng.h It can be
           used in other projects to access libmng.dll created with the
           win32dll example above.


unix - Unix (found under contrib/gcc/xxx)
-----------------------------------------

mngtree  - basically a copy of the BCB sample. It includes a makefile for
           Linux and it's been tested on RedHat6.2
