2010-11-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

        * Several demosaic algorithms, found in other open-source RAW processing
          packages are implemented in LibRaw. 

          1) DCB demosaic and FBDD denoise by Jacek Gozdz are included in 
             main LibRaw source.
          2) GPL2 demosaic pack with these demosaic methods:
             * AFD and LMMSE implementations from PerfectRaw by Manuel Llorens
             * VCD, Modified AHD, post-demosaic refinemend and median
               filters by Paul Lee
          3) GPL3 demosaic pack with AMaZe interpolation  by Emil Martinec

          See more details in README.demosaic-packs
        
        * Current implementation of dcraw_emu sample allows only selection
          of demosaic method (via -q) options. All other parameters change
          will be implemented later.

	* LibRaw 0.12-alpha1

2010-10-16 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * internal/dcraw_fileio.c can be compiled with -DDCRAW_VERBOSE again
           * fixed comment style in libraw_datastream.h
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta6

2010-10-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * New changes to I/O layer. Three LibRaw_*datastream clasees are
             exists: 
               + LibRaw_buffer_datastream - buffer reaging
               + LibRaw_file_datastream - file reading using iostreams
                 (large files are no supported on some systems)
               + LibRaw_bigfile_datastream - FILE*-based file I/O

           *  file/bigfile_datastream is selected automatically by
              LibRaw::open_file based on input file size.
              By default, files larger than 250Mb are opened using
              bigfile interface, you may change this behaviour
              by using second optional parameter of open_file()

           * There is no way to use default parameter values in C API,
             so new call libraw_open_file_ex added with two parameters
             (file name and minimal file size for bigfile_datastream use).

           * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

           * All LibRaw_abstract_datastream functions are virtual again. You may
             (again) use your own I/O layer.

           * new -d key for dcraw_emu sample: print timings of processing stages

           * simple_dcraw sample simplified: no mmap code

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta5

2010-10-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in exception handling in OpenMP sections in 
             AHD interpolation code.

           * LibRaw_datastreams are now C++ iostreams based instead of old
             plain FILE* calls.
             LibRaw::open_file() in multithreaded programs are WAY faster
             on many OSes (Linux, Windows, MacOSX) because of no extra locks.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta4


2010-10-01 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in LibRaw::dcraw_process() code: for half_size
             processing, params.four_color_rgb was set to 1 internally
             and not returned back after postprocessing.

           * Several Visual Studio 2003 compatibility fixes

            * AHD interpolation refactored. Now it is about 10% faster than
              dcraw in single-process mode and up to 1.5 times faster on
              4-core and OpenMP (total execution time counted, not AHD itself)
              Thanks to Adam Hooper
           * AHD interpolation refactored. Now it is about 10% faster than
             dcraw in single-process mode and up to 1.5 times faster on

             Thanks to Adam Hooper
              
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta3

2010-09-07 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Phase One files: LibRaw::unpack() sets colordata.black to
             approximately correct value. 

           * Fixed minor error in setting colordata.maximum value
             for Phase One files.

           * LibRaw::subtract_black() sets colordata.black and
             colordata.cblack[] to zero to preserve data integrity.

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta2
             

2010-09-04 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * It is now possible to crop output image on postprocessing
            stage (dcraw_process). Coordinates and size of the output box
            are set via imgdata.params.cropbox[4] parameter. Look into
            LibRaw documentation for more details.

              + New fatal error code LIBRAW_BAD_CROP

              + New dcraw_emu sample command line switch: -B x y w h
                (sets cropbox)

             Thanks to Patrick and Jan.

            * Processing pipeline has changed: the black level is subtracted
              from data on postprocessing stage either automatically 
              (on dcraw_process() stage) or by special LibRaw API call:

               + New API calls:  LibRaw::subtract_black() (C++ API) and
                 libraw_subtract_black (C API). 
                 If you use dcraw_process() or dcraw_document_mode_processing()
                 calls YOU DON'T NEED to call subtract_black() directly.
               
               + The raw preprocessing mode LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOBLACKS
                 is deprecated and removed from LibRaw.

             * New ./configure script.
               Use ./configure -h for usage details.
               Thanks to Siddhesh Poyarekar

             * New API cals static LibRaw::dcraw_clear_mem() (C++ API)
               and libraw_dcraw_clear_mem(..) (C API).
               This calls are used to free memory, allocated by
               dcraw_make_mem_image() and dcraw_make_mem_thumb() instead
               of free() call.

               In some cases LibRaw and calling process have different
               memory managers, so free() of make_mem_image() data 
               results to program crash (especially in Win32/VisualStudio
               enviroment).

             * LibRaw::free() is now private instead of public (again).

             * Minor changes and bugfixes:

               + Memory allocation exceptions (std::bad_alloc) are caught,
                 so LibRaw API calls will return reasonable error codes
                 instead of C++ exception (possibly unhandled).
                 This problem is very unlikely to see in wild: if application
                 cannot allocate small data for internal structure, it will 
                 always fail on allocation for RAW image data.

               + WIN32/VisualStudio 2008/2010: fopen,fscanf and sscanf calls
                 in Libraw_datastream code are changed to *_s (secure) ones.

               + Debug print removed from fatal error handler.

               + Mmaped I/O for dcraw_emu sample is turned on via -E switch
                 now (because old -B switch is used for settng cropbox).

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size change
           
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta1

               Samsung EX1, Sony A450
             + Color data changed for some cameras

               Kodak Z981, Panasonic G2 and G10, Phase One P65, 
               Samsung NX-10 and WB550, Sony NEX-3 and NEX-5.
             + Fixed file descriptor leak in dark frame subtraction processing

           * Fixed dcraw 9.01's bug in DNG black level processing

           * Preliminary support for Sony A450 camera.

           * New command-line switch -h in mem_image sample (half_size support)

           * Some patches by Johannes Hanika (darktable author):
              + OpenMP speedup  for PPG-interpolation
              + green_matching  - suppress of 'color maze' on cameras with
              different green channel sensitivity. This option is turns on
              by  filed with same name in imgdata.params
            
           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * LibRaw::free() is now public instead of private.

           * LibRaw 0.10.0-Beta1.

2010-05-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta4

2010-04-09 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * Fixed typecast error (problem reported only on gcc 4.2.1/32bit)
            in CRW files processing.

           * C++ API call LibRaw::adjust_maximum() is now deprecated and
             de-documented, use params.adjust_maximum_thr instead (on by default)

           *  C-API call libraw_adjust_maximum() removed.

           * New postprocessing parameter params.adjust_maximum_thr
             This parameter replaces LibRaw::adjust_maximum(), but more flexible
             Defaults are reasonable (0.75, same as in old adjust_maximum),
             look into documentation for more details.

           * Removed last OpenMP warning

           * dcraw_emu's -c parameter now wants numeric (float) argument. This value
             is assigned to params.adjust_maximum_thr.
             Use -c 0.0 for dcraw compatibility.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta3

           New licensing:

           * Triple licensing (selected by LibRaw user):

              + LGPL 2.1 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
              + CDDL 1.0 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.txt)

               (http://www.libraw.org/data/LICENSE.LibRaw.pdf)

           * There is no separate LibRaw-Lite and LibRaw-Commercial versions,
             only single LibRaw.
             Current LibRaw-Lite and LibRaw-Commercial users should switch
             to LibRaw without loss of functionality.
             It is possible to change licensig too (e.g. from LGPL to CDDL
             for LibRaw-Lite users and from LibRaw License to LGPL or CDDL
             for LibRaw-Commercial users).

           * No Foveon support :(
             It is not possible to get good color from Foveon sensors with
             *any* converter. So, there is no need to support these cameras.
             Dcraw's Foveon-processing code is too strict licensed (GPL),
             so we choose to drop it.
             
           New Features:

           * New data field  colordata.channel_maximum[4] - per channel data
            maximum (calculated for most cameras, 0 for others).

           * New call LibRaw::adjust_maximum() (and libraw_adjust_maximum() in C API).
             This call changes hardcoded colordata.maximum value to calculated
             at unpack stage. This helps suppress false color in highlights
             (magenta clouds and so).

           * New command line parameter -c for dcraw_emu sample. Calls adjust_maximum()
             for each processed file.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta1

                Phase One P65, Samsung S850
             + Removed hardcoded white-balance data for many P&S cameras.
               It is recommended to set params.use_camera_wb to 1 for 
               safe WB.
           * Fixes for Nikon D5000 files: no pink stripe at 
             right side of frame
           * C-wrapper: added missed calls
               libraw_dcraw_make_mem_image

           * Minor fixes to make non-gcc compilers more happy
           * Internal structures changed, full recompilation of all client 
             code is needed.
           * LibRaw 0.8.0-Beta4
                
2009-06-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * API changed: params.gamma_16bit field removed. Gamma curve is
             set via params.gamm[0]/gamm[1] values (see documentation and 
             samples for details)
           * LibRaw::identify() splitted to avoid MS VS2008 bug (too many 
             nested blocks)

           * Samples: dcraw_emu and mem_image samples supports new dcraw 
              16bit/gamma semantics:
                -6: set 16 bit output
                -4: set 16 bit output and linear gamma curve and no auto 
                   brighness

           * Many compiler warnings removed

2009-04-07 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * More accurate types conversion in libraw_datastream.h 
           * New postprocessing parameter auto_bright_thr: set portion of 
             clipped pixels for auto brightening code (instead of 
             dcraw-derived hardcoded 1%)
           * -U  option for dcraw_emu sample sets auto_bright_thr parameter
           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size

             + more accurate pentax dSLR support
             + fixes in Kodak 620x/720x identification
             + faster identification procedure for some formats.
           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta5


2009-03-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

             + Pentax K2000/Km support
             + Changes in Canon sRAW processing (support for 5D2 fw 1.07)

           * all client code should be recompiled

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta4

2009-02-13 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * bugfix: 4channels sample finally subtracts black by default
           * dcraw 8.91/1.419 imported:
              + fixes in RIFF files parsing

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta3

2009-02-12 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Black level was not calculated for Canon RAWs in
             some filtering modes

           * 4channels sample prints calculated black level
             (scaled if autoscaling used). 
             Also output file names for this sample now includes 
             color channel name (R/G/B/G2 or C/M/Y/G)

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta2

2009-02-09 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * New sample 4channels: splits RAW color channels into four 
             separate TIFFs

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta1

2009-02-07 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in external jpeg metadata reading code.

           * Cleaned some C++ warnings

           * dcraw 8.91/1.418 imported
             + Hasselblad V96C support

           * You need to clean and recompile client code which
             uses LibRaw_*_datastream classes.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha6

2009-01-30  Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * New data input framework is created. It is possible now to
             easyly implement your own data input interface for LibRaw
             (e.g. for reading RAW data from network data stream)
             
           * All older programs using previous LibRaw versions are
	     compatible at source code level.

           * LibRaw can read RAW data from memory buffer via
             new LibRaw::open_buffer() API call (implemented on top of
             new input framework). 
             This call used in sample application dcraw_emu and simple_dcraw
             (with -B command-line switch) to test new API.

           * Error handling callback functions now can be called with
             NULL filename passed (if underlying data stream object
             does not know file name).
             So, client error handling callbacks should work with NULL
             filename.

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.417:
              + Support for loading White Balance data from
                Sony ARW files edited with Sony IDC software.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha5

2009-01-17 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Raw filtering mode LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS has renamed
            to LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE for better reflect its purpose.
            This filtering_mode bit turns off tone curve applying on
            RAW data on bayer-pattern cameras with raw tone curve:
              + Adobe DNG (only RAW with bayer pattern)
              + Nikon compressed NEF
              + Some Kodak cameras
              + Sony A700/A900 (tone curve applied to 8-bit raws)

           * unprocessed_raw sample: added command-line key -N, this key
             turns on LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE filtering mode.

           * New scheme of Fuji RAW processing (introduced in 0.7-Alpha3)
             supports DNG files generated from Fuji RAF.
           
           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.416:
              + better support for Samsung S85
              + fixed possible integer overflow in wavelet denoising code

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha4


2009-01-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Black mask extraction supported for all files with bayer data
            (one component per pixel). Black mask data not avaliable
            for multi-component data (Foveon, Canon sRAW, Sinar 4-shot,
            Kodak YCC/YRGB).

           * Black level subtraction can be turned off for all bayer
            cameras (added support for PhaseOne backs).

           * Fujifilm camera processing model changed:
              + RAW data is extracted without 45-degree rotation
              + dcraw-compatible rotation is performed on postptocessing stage
              + it is possible to rotate RAW data without postprocessing
                by LibRaw::rotate_fuji_raw() call.

           * New filtering mode setting: LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS
             This bits turns off RAW tone curve processing based on tone curve
             readed from RAW metadata.
             This mode supported only for PhaseOne backs now (to be supported
             on all relevant cameras in nearest future releases)

           * Black level data (got from RAW data) are stored for PhaseOne backs.

           * Black level subtraction bug (derived from dcraw) fixed
             for PhaseOne files.

           * Fixed processing of -s parameter for dcraw_emu sample
           
           * Parameter  -s N (select shot number) added to 
             unprocessed_raw sample.

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.414:
              + changes in QuickTake 100 metadata processing
              + changes in external jpeg processing code
              + Samsung S85 support

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha3 released

2009-01-10 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in add_masked_borders: crash if output dimensions
            is already larger than raw dimensions
            * Fixed out of bounds in samples/unprocessed_raw.cpp for files
            with non-square pixels

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha2 released
           
2009-01-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in  0.7.0-a0: black frame size has not reset, 
             so in batch processing there is an error in black frame
             size for files without black frame.

           * Implemented reading of black/masked pixels data for 
             near all cameras with masked pixels, exclding:
              + Canon sRAW, Leaf (MOS), Sinar 4-shot - more than one 
                color component in black frame (redesign of black frame
                data structures required).
              + Fuji SuperCCD: need to design right methods of extraction 
                (should we rotate and resize black pixels as active ones??)

            * Tested for most dSLR data formats with masked pixels: 7 of 9
              untested formats are from old P&S cameras.

           * New call LibRaw::unpack_function_name() returns unpack function name
             (useful for testers only)

           * New identify sample parameters (useful for test-suite builders
             to check test coverage):
                  -u - print unpack function name
                  -f - print masked frame size
             These parameters works only for identify run without -v parameter

           * Imported dcraw 8.89/1.411
             + changes in Panasonic FZ50 files parsing

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha1 released


2009-01-05 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * It is possible to turn off RAW data filtration (black level 
             subtraction,              zero pixels averaging):
                + supported on all cameras except Foveon and Phase One
                + filtraction controlled by new parameter "filtering_mode"
                + it is possible to expand API by filtering procedures 
                  built for specific camera model.

           * Black border (masked pixels) extraction:
                + API (data structures) for storing black mask.
                + Black mask extraction supported only for limited list of
                  data formats: 
                       - Canon .CRW, .CR2 (with exception of sRAW),A600, A5
                       - Adobe DNG (both converted RAW and native DNG)
                       - Nikon NEF (compressed only)
                  this list to be expanded in future LibRaw versions
           * New call add_masked_borders_to_bitmap makes full bitmap
             'masked border' + image
           * Usage sample for functionality listed above: 
              samples/unprocessed_raw 
           * Imported dcraw 8.89/1.410:
              + fixed bugs in Hasselblad .fff decoding
              + fixes in Imacon metadata decoding
           * Documentation changes
           * All client code should be recompiled
           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha0


2009-01-01 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
