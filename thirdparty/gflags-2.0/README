This repository contains a C++ of the Google commandline flags module.
Documentation for the C++ implementation is in doc/. The python version of
gflags is now shipped seperately as it is completely independent of this
module.

See INSTALL for (generic) installation instructions for C++: basically
   ./configure && make && make install

See README_windows.txt for instructions on using under windows.
