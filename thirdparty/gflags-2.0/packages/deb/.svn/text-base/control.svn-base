Description: a library that implements commandline flags
 processing.  As such it's a replacement for getopt().  It has increased
 flexibility, including built-in support for C++ types like string, and
 the ability to define flags in the source file in which they're used.
 The devel package contains static and debug libraries and header files
 for developing applications that use the gflags package.
