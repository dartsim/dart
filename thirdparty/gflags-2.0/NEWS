== 25 January 2012 ==

I've just released gflags 2.0.

The `google-gflags` project has been renamed to `gflags`.  I
(csilvers) am stepping down as maintainer, to be replaced by Andreas
Schuh.  Welcome to the team, Andreas!  I've seen the energy you have
around gflags and the ideas you have for the project going forward,
and look forward to having you on the team.

I bumped the major version number up to 2 to reflect the new community
ownership of the project.  All the
[http://gflags.googlecode.com/svn/tags/gflags-2.0/ChangeLog changes]
are related to the renaming.  There are no functional changes from
gflags 1.7.  In particular, I've kept the code in the namespace
`google`, though in a future version it should be renamed to `gflags`.
I've also kept the `/usr/local/include/google/` subdirectory as
synonym of `/usr/local/include/gflags/`, though the former name has
been obsolete for some time now.

The `google-gflags` Google Code page has been renamed to
`gflags`, in preparation for the project being renamed to
`gflags`.  In the coming weeks, I'll be stepping down as
maintainer for the gflags project, and as part of that Google is
relinquishing ownership of the project; it will now be entirely
community run.  The name change reflects that shift.

I've just released gflags 1.7.  This is a minor release; the major
change is that `CommandLineFlagInfo` now exports the address in memory
where the flag is located.  There has also been a bugfix involving
very long --help strings, and some other minor
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.7/ChangeLog changes].

=== 29 July 2011 ===

I've just released gflags 1.6.  The major new feature in this release
is support for setting version info, so that --version does something
useful.

One minor change has required bumping the library number:
`ReparseCommandlineFlags` now returns `void` instead of `int` (the int
return value was always meaningless).  Though I doubt anyone ever used
this (meaningless) return value, technically it's a change to the ABI
that requires a version bump.  A bit sad.

There's also a procedural change with this release: I've changed the
internal tools used to integrate Google-supplied patches for gflags
into the opensource release.  These new tools should result in more
frequent updates with better change descriptions.  They will also
result in future `ChangeLog` entries being much more verbose (for better
or for worse).

See the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.6/ChangeLog ChangeLog]
for a full list of changes for this release.

=== 24 January 2011 ===

I've just released gflags 1.5.  This release has only minor changes
from 1.4, including some slightly better reporting in --help, and
an new memory-cleanup function that can help when running gflags-using
libraries under valgrind.  The major change is to fix up the macros
(`DEFINE_bool` and the like) to work more reliably inside namespaces.

If you have not had a problem with these macros, and don't need any of
the other changes described, there is no need to upgrade.  See the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.5/ChangeLog ChangeLog]
for a full list of changes for this release.

=== 11 October 2010 ===

I've just released gflags 1.4.  This release has only minor changes
from 1.3, including some documentation tweaks and some work to make
the library smaller.  If 1.3 is working well for you, there's no
particular reason to upgrade.

=== 4 January 2010 ===

I've just released gflags 1.3.  gflags now compiles under MSVC, and
all tests pass.  I *really* never thought non-unix-y Windows folks
would want gflags, but at least some of them do.

The major news, though, is that I've separated out the python package
into its own library, [http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags python-gflags].
If you're interested in the Python version of gflags, that's the place to
get it now.

=== 10 September 2009 ==

I've just released gflags 1.2.  The major change from gflags 1.1 is it
now compiles under MinGW (as well as cygwin), and all tests pass.  I
never thought Windows folks would want unix-style command-line flags,
since they're so different from the Windows style, but I guess I was
wrong!

The other changes are minor, such as support for --htmlxml in the
python version of gflags.

=== 15 April 2009 ===

I've just released gflags 1.1.  It has only minor changes fdrom gflags
1.0 (see the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.1/ChangeLog ChangeLog]
for details).  The major change is that I moved to a new
system for creating .deb and .rpm files.  This allows me to create
x86_64 deb and rpm files.

In the process of moving to this new system, I noticed an
inconsistency: the tar.gz and .rpm files created libraries named
libgflags.so, but the deb file created libgoogle-gflags.so.  I have
fixed the deb file to create libraries like the others.  I'm no expert
in debian packaging, but I believe this has caused the package name to
change as well.  Please let me know (at
[mailto:google-gflags@googlegroups.com
google-gflags@googlegroups.com]) if this causes problems for you --
especially if you know of a fix!  I would be happy to change the deb
packages to add symlinks from the old library name to the new
(libgoogle-gflags.so -> libgflags.so), but that is beyond my knowledge
of how to make .debs.

If you've tried to install a .rpm or .deb and it doesn't work for you,
let me know.  I'm excited to finally have 64-bit package files, but
there may still be some wrinkles in the new system to iron out.

===1 October 2008===

gflags 1.0rc2 was out for a few weeks without any issues, so gflags
1.0 is now released.  This is much like gflags 0.9.  The major change
is that the .h files have been moved from `/usr/include/google` to
`/usr/include/gflags`.  While I have backwards-compatibility
forwarding headeds in place, please rewrite existing code to say
{{{
   #include <gflags/gflags.h>
}}}
instead of
{{{
   #include <google/gflags.h>
}}}

I've kept the default namespace to google.  You can still change with
with the appropriate flag to the configure script (`./configure
--help` to see the flags).  If you have feedback as to whether the
default namespace should change to gflags, which would be a
non-backwards-compatible change, send mail to
`google-gflags@googlegroups.com`!

Version 1.0 also has some neat new features, like support for bash
commandline-completion of help flags.  See the
[http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/source/browse/tags/gflags-1.0rc2/ChangeLog
ChangeLog] for more details.

If I don't hear any bad news for a few weeks, I'll release 1.0-final.
