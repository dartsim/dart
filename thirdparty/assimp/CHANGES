CHANGELOG
----------------------------------------------------------------------



2.0 (2010-11-21)

FEATURES:
   - Add support for static Blender (*.blend) scenes
   - Add support for Q3BSP scenes
   - Add a windows-based OpenGL sample featuring texturing & basic materials
   - Add an experimental progress feedback interface.
   - Vastly improved performance (up to 500%, depending on mesh size and
     spatial structure) in some expensive postprocessing steps
   - AssimpView now uses a reworked layout which leaves more space
     to the scene hierarchy window
     
   - Add C# bindings ('Assimp.NET')
   - Keep BSD-licensed and otherwise free test files in separate 
     folders (./test/models and ./test/models-nonbsd).

FIXES:
   - Many Collada bugfixes, improve fault tolerance
   - Fix possible crashes in the Obj loader
   - Improve the Ogre XML loader
   - OpenGL-sample now works with MinGW
   - Fix Importer::FindLoader failing on uppercase file extensions
   - Fix flawed path handling when locating external files
   - Limit the maximum number of vertices, faces, face indices and 
     weights that Assimp is able to handle. This is to avoid
     crashes due to overflowing counters.
   
   - Updated XCode project files
   - Further CMAKE build improvements
   

API CHANGES:
   - Add data structures for vertex-based animations (These are not
     currently used, however ...)
   - Some Assimp::Importer methods are const now.
 
 





1.1 (2010-04-17)
This is the list of relevant changes from the 1.0 (r412) release to 1.1 (r700).

FEATURES:
  - Vastly improved Collada support
  - Add MS3D (Milkshape 3D) support
  - Add support for Ogre XML static meshes
  - Add experimental COB (TrueSpace) support
  - Automatic test suite to quickly locate regressions
  - D bindings (`dAssimp`)
  - Python 2.n bindings (`PyAssimp`)
  - Add basic support for Unicode input files (utf8, utf16 and utf32)
  - Add further utilities to the `assimp` tool (xml/binary dumps, quick file stats)
  - Switch to a CMAKE-based build system including an install target for unix'es
  - Automatic evaluation of subdivision surfaces for some formats.
  - Add `Importer::ReadFileFromMemory` and the corresponding C-API `aiReadFileFromMemory`
  - Expose further math utilities via the C-API (i.e. `aiMultiplyMatrix4`)

  - Move noboost files away from the public include directory
  - Many, many bugfixes and improvements in existing loaders and postprocessing steps
  - Documentation improved and clarified in many places.
  - Add a sample on using Assimp in conjunction with OpenGL

  - Distribution/packaging: comfortable SDK installer for Windows
  - Distribution/packaging: improved release packages for other architectures

CRITICAL FIXES:
  - Resolve problems with clashing heap managers, STL ABIs and runtime libraries (win32)
  - Fix automatic detection of file type if no file extension is given
  - Improved exception safety and robustness, prevent leaking of exceptions through the C interface
  - Fix possible heap corruption due to material properties pulled in incorrectly
  - Avoid leaking in certain error scenarios
  - Fix 64 bit compatibility problems in some loaders (i.e. MDL)

BREAKING API CHANGES:
  - None -

MINOR API BEHAVIOUR CHANGES:
 - Change quaternion orientation to suit to the more common convention (-w).
 - aiString is utf8 now. Not yet consistent, however.
