TiCPP (TinyXML C++ wrapper)
---------------------------------------------------
Introduction:
	'TiCPP' is short for the official name TinyXML++. It is a completely new
	interface to TinyXML (http://http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) that
	uses MANY of the C++ strengths. Templates, exceptions, and much better error
	handling. It is also fully documented in doxygen. It is really cool because
	this version let's you interface tiny the exact same way as before or you
	can choose to use the new 'TiCPP' classes. All you need to do is define
	TIXML_USE_TICPP. It has been tested in VC 6.0, VC 7.0, VC 7.1, VC 8.0,
	MinGW gcc 3.4.5, and in Linux GNU gcc 3+.

	TinyXML++ uses Premake as the build system, so you won't find any project files
	because you generate them for your specific system. Premake is a build script
	generator. Premake supports creatation of build scripts for:

		* MS Visual Studio 6, 2002, 2003, or 2005
		* GNU make (including Cygwin and MinGW)
		* Code::Blocks
		* And more ...

Build Steps:
	1) Download Premake from http://premake.sf.net/download
	2) Checkout the source for TinyXML++ using Subversion.
		- svn checkout http://ticpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ticpp
	3) Place the Premake executable in the root directory of TiCPP or somewhere in your
	   path.
	4) To create the needed build files navigate to the TinyXML++ directory (ticpp)
	   and type:

		* Code::Blocks Projects and workspace:
			* Premake v3.x:	premake --target cb-gcc [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]
			* Premake v4.x:	premake4 codeblocks [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]

		* GNU makefiles:
			* Premake v3.x:	premake --target gnu [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]
			* Premake v4.x:	premake4 gmake [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]

		* Visual Studio 2005 (8.0) [Windows ONLY]
			* Premake v3.x:	premake --target vs2005 [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]
			* Premake v4.x:	premake4 vs2005 [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]

		* Visual Studio 2008 (9.0) [Windows ONLY]
			* Premake v3.x:	premake --target vs2008 [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]
			* Premake v4.x:	premake4 vs2008 [--unicode] [--dynamic-runtime] [--ticpp-shared]

	5) Now use the build system of your choice.

		- For Code::Blocks, use the generated .cbp/.workspace to build TinyXML++ as a
		  static library.

		- For GNU makefiles type: (Assumes you have properly setup your system to build
		  with gcc or MinGW)

			* Release:
				make CONFIG=Release

			* Debug:
				make
		- For Visual Studio, use the generated .vcproj/.sln to build TinyXML++ as a
		  static library.

Notes:
	- Premake can be found here:
	  http://premake.sourceforge.net

	- Subversion is a great free cross-platform version control manager.
	  It can be found here:
	  http://subversion.tigris.org

	- Code::Blocks is a free cross-platform IDE and it can be found here:
	  http://codeblocks.org
