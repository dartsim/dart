Troubleshooting Installation Issues on Windows 7 with Visual Studio (2010)

So you want to run this in Windows? 
Unfortunately, the build process is not quite as straightforward as it is on non-Unix-based systems.

This document lays out some common problems encountered while attempting to build on Windows 7 (64-bit) for Visual Studio 2010.
These are meant to be suggestions in case you run into issues; they are not necessarily solutions for all problems.
In the future, some of these problems may be resolved by developing a better CMake file for Windows.

1. Building Third-Party Libraries
  a. General
	Be sure to build all third-party libraries using the same compiler/runtime (same version of Visual Studio).
	This may require conversions between project/solution files provided by the third party libraries.
	Also be sure that you are compiling with the same Runtime Library flag (e.g. /MD for release builds, /MDD for debug builds).
  b. SNOPT
	Snopt is a Fortran library and must be compiled with a separate compiler into a library.
	As mentioned before, this is most easily achieved with Intel's Parallel Studio XE.
  c. Naming Conventions
	The names of compiled libraries may not necessarily match what the Ground Zero solution file is expecting.
	Since it is infinitely more tedious to change all of the project settings, we suggest renaming the libraries.
	In particular, for gtest and gflags, you may be required to rename the static libraries from "lib*.lib" to "*.lib".
	For the corresponding DLLs, keep "lib*.dll" as "lib*.dll".
  d. Library Locations
	All static library (.lib) files should be placed in (repo)/thirdparty/lib.
	For most of the third party libraries, these will automatically be placed in the directory once they are built.
	However, certain libraries may require you copy them in manually after building them.
	Any needed DLL files (e.g. libgflags.dll) can be placed in the bin folder for the Visual C/C++ compiler.
	(A sample path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin.)

2. Missing Libraries/Dependencies at Compile-Time
  a. Missing .h files
	For the project, go to Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories.
	Add the path to the corresponding third-party header file.
	1. (FreeImage.h): (repo)/thirdparty/FreeImage-*/Source
	2. (gtest/gtest.h): (repo)/thirdparty/gtest-*/fused_src
  b. gfortran.lib
	Remove this from the list of additional dependencies in Properties -> Config. Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies.
	If SNOPT was compiled with Parallel Studio XE, you will then likely be asked for libraries such as 'ifconsol.lib'.
	These are located in the Intel compiler's 'lib' folder in Program Files.
	(A sample path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\ComposerXE-2011\compiler\lib\ia32.)
	(You may either copy these into the third party lib folder or link this as an additional include directory).
	To link, modify Properties -> Config. Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories.
	If additional linker errors occur (e.g. LNK 4098) for duplicated methods, you may need to exclude libcmt.lib or msvcrt.lib.
	This can be done in Properties -> Config. Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Ignore Specific Default Libraries.

3. Running Sample Apps
  a. Anything using SNOPT
	Make sure that you have a fort.4 file present in the directory containing the project/source files.
	A sample fort.4 file lives in (repo)/bin.
	
Note: Currently, every time CMake rebuilds the project/solution files, it will blast over changes made in points 2-3.
You will need to repeat the process to add/remove dependencies and copy the fort.4 files.
