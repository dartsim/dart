# DART: Improve Prompts

Task completed. Now review and improve `docs/prompts/` based on what we learned.

Scope
- Only edit files in `docs/prompts/`.
- Follow `docs/prompts/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- No product/code changes.

Actions
1. Verify existing prompts are still accurate after workflow/tool changes.
2. Propose a better starting prompt for this type of task (if applicable).
3. Add, tighten, merge, or remove prompts as needed.
4. Update `docs/prompts/AGENTS.md` index if files change.

Rules
- Keep prompts short, task-scoped, reusable.
- Use `<PLACEHOLDER>` format.
- No ephemeral IDs (branches, PRs, commits, usernames).
- Prefer verification/merging/tightening over adding new prompts.

Output
- Summary of changes with rationale.
- Files edited.
