# Issue 3056 DART 6 Performance

## Current Snapshot

Bottom line: DART 6 performance work is continuing on `release-6.20` as a PR
stack. The baseline PR records the workload and consumes final state so RTF
numbers are not dead-code artifacts. Follow-up PRs must compare baseline,
previous PR, and current PR on the same command line whenever they claim a
speedup.

- PR0 `jslee02/issue-3056-baseline-sdf-perf` / #3089 adds the baseline
  benchmark, GUI verifier, reset path, HUD, drop-state scene generation, and
  final-state checks.
- Baseline evidence, Bullet collision, 120 generated objects, 9000 steps,
  default sleeping: RTF `0.882581`, final contacts `360`, final resting
  `81 / 120`, finite state true, final hash `0x212c1143bd0a2fb3`.
- Baseline evidence, same scene with deactivation disabled: RTF `0.740188`,
  final contacts `360`, final resting `0 / 120`, finite state true, final hash
  `0xcf3145a17b2cada2`.
- PR1 #3085 adds primitive plane and contact-cap collision support. Current
  review fix preserves FCL backend object identity across shape refresh and
  removes shared objects from the group that originally registered them, rather
  than from the object's current shape type.
- PR1 current default Bullet run, same 120-object/9000-step command as PR0:
  RTF `0.915975`, final contacts `360`, final resting `81 / 120`, finite state
  true, final hash `0x212c1143bd0a2fb3`. This preserves PR0 final state.
- PR1 `--max-contacts-per-pair 4`, same Bullet command: RTF `0.897063`, same
  final hash `0x212c1143bd0a2fb3`. This is correctness-preserving here but not
  a speedup for Bullet.
- PR1 FCL primitive short check, 120 objects, 3000 steps: uncapped RTF
  `0.0511826`, capped at 4 contacts/pair RTF `0.131733`, but final hashes and
  state diverged substantially. That cap must remain explicit for this path
  unless follow-up work proves a physically equivalent cap policy.
- Next collision diff should implement a contact-manifold reduction/selection
  algorithm before making any four-contact-per-pair behavior default-on. The
  goal is to choose representative, well-distributed contact points for each
  pair instead of truncating backend contact output in iteration order. Required
  evidence: same original #3056 command line, baseline vs previous vs current
  RTF, final-state hash/summaries, and focused tests showing preserved contact
  support for boxes, cylinders, spheres, and planes.
- Prior-art search found three useful sources: closed PR #2366 had a generic
  `constraint::ContactManifoldCache` with persistent pair history, deepest
  contact plus spatially spread contact selection, a box-stacking GUI
  comparison, C++/dartpy tests, and `bm_contact_manifold_cache`; merged PR
  #2125 and release backport #2902 added an ODE-specific DART 6 contact-history
  cache for sparse capsule contacts; and merged DART 7 native-collision PRs
  #2652/#2688 added `ContactManifold`, `PersistentManifoldCache`, and box-box
  contact reduction under `dart/collision/native`.
- Sequencing decision: keep #3085 as the plane/contact-cap plumbing and evidence
  PR. The default-on behavior belongs in a later manifold-reduction PR that
  mines #2366 and DART 7 native collision, then proves equivalence before
  changing core defaults.
- PR2 #3086 must make any behavior-preserving performance path default-on if it
  is safe for gz-physics compatibility. Any default speedup must be backed by a
  fidelity/correctness test, not just an RTF improvement.

## Default-On Correctness Rule

Performance behavior should be default-on only when the physical behavior stays
the same within the intended DART 6 compatibility surface. A fast path that
changes contact generation, wake/sleep transitions, reset behavior, final
finite-state checks, or final state summaries must be treated as a correctness
bug until proven otherwise.

## PR Split

1. PR0: reproducible baseline tests, benchmark/example, GUI/headless verifier,
   final-state consumption, and `.benchmark_results/` ignore coverage.
2. PR1: collision detector and contact-generation improvements. Compare against
   PR0 and add focused collision correctness regressions.
3. PR2: resting-world/deactivation and solver hot-loop improvements. Compare
   against PR0 and PR1, and verify default-on behavior preserves fidelity.
4. PR3 candidate: contact-manifold reduction/selection. This should be a
   separate review from PR1 because PR1's per-pair cap is a measurement and
   control knob, while this follow-up must preserve contact-patch fidelity well
   enough to justify default-on behavior.
5. Later PRs: larger backend swaps or DART 7 native collision detector ports,
   only after available collision-engine comparisons show the dependency and
   correctness tradeoffs clearly.
