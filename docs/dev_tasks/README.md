# Development Tasks

Documentation for development tasks in DART.

## Structure

- **active/** - Currently active projects with task trackers

## Guidelines

**Maintaining task documentation:**
- Keep docs updated with current progress and status
- Focus on latest state and lessons learned, not full history
- Remove outdated details as tasks evolve
- When tasks are completed: Consider updating docs in `docs/onboarding/` instead of archiving here. Keep onboarding docs accumulating and up-to-date with the latest best practices and learnings

**Before committing:**
- Run `validate_changes` to check for errors
- Update task status in tracker

**Documentation standards:**
- Agent-agnostic (useful for both humans and AI)
- No author names or ownership attribution
- Include testing/validation steps
- Document key decisions and troubleshooting
