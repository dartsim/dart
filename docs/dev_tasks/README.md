# Development Tasks

Documentation for development tasks in DART.

## Structure

- **active/** - Currently active projects with task trackers
- **completed/** - Archived completed tasks (optional)

## Guidelines

**Maintaining task documentation:**
- Keep docs updated with current progress and status
- Focus on latest state and lessons learned, not full history
- Remove outdated details as tasks evolve
- Archive completed tasks when no longer actively referenced

**Before committing:**
- Run `validate_changes` to check for errors
- Update task status in tracker

**Documentation standards:**
- Agent-agnostic (useful for both humans and AI)
- No author names or ownership attribution
- Include testing/validation steps
- Document key decisions and troubleshooting
