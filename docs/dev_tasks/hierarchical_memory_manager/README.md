# Hierarchical Memory Manager — Dev Task

## Current Status

- [x] Phase 1: Experimental `World` owns a memory manager and exposes
      frame-scratch diagnostics.
- [ ] Phase 2: Allocator correctness and performance gates cover DART
      allocators against standard C++ allocators and foonathan/memory.
- [ ] Phase 3: EnTT registry/component storage allocation is configurable from
      the World memory hierarchy and covered by no-growth ECS tests.
      Initial registry/component-storage wiring is implemented; bake-time
      reservation and no-growth ECS tests remain open.
- [ ] Phase 4: Built-in simulation stages borrow world memory for transient
      buffers and avoid growth after simulation is baked.
- [ ] Phase 5: Add allocation/debug accounting gates for "no dynamic allocation
      during the step loop" on representative rigid, multibody, contact, and
      deformable scenes.
- [ ] Phase 6: Add memory-layout profiler/debugger surfaces and GUI
      visualization.

## Goal

Move the experimental simulation stack toward zero dynamic memory allocation in
the simulation loop by giving each `World` one hierarchical allocator root and
routing persistent and per-frame data through that root. Long term, the memory
hierarchy should map cleanly to world objects/components so it can drive memory
debugging, profiling, optimization experiments, and ImGui visualization.

## Non-Goals For The First Slice

- Do not claim zero allocations for every experimental solver path yet.
- Do not replace Eigen's internal heap behavior in one pass.
- Do not expose ECS storage, solver registries, or backend resource types in
  public memory diagnostics.

## Key Decisions

- Reuse `dart::common::MemoryManager` as the allocator hierarchy root instead
  of introducing a simulation-only allocator stack for the first slice, but do
  not assume the current allocator implementations are correct or fast enough.
- Follow the existing common-module rule: `World` owns the memory manager;
  stages and components borrow allocators from the world.
- Treat frame scratch as valid for the current simulation frame and reset it at
  the start of the next `World::step()` call.
- Treat `entt::registry` allocation as a first-class integration target. The
  ECS storage layer is a dominant owner of world/component memory, so future
  work must either instantiate the registry/storage with a DART allocator or
  provide an equivalent EnTT storage integration that preserves public API
  boundaries.
- The active EnTT version supports stateful allocator propagation through
  `entt::basic_registry`: the experimental World now constructs its internal
  registry and component storages with a `dart::common::StlAllocator` borrowing
  the World's active free allocator.
- Free-list allocations must preserve at least `std::max_align_t` alignment
  after every split. EnTT component storage surfaced this as an Eigen
  `FrameCache` alignment failure when a max-aligned component allocation
  followed an odd-sized allocation.
- Broad hot-loop adoption is blocked until allocator correctness tests and
  benchmarks prove DART's allocators beat both standard C++ allocators and
  foonathan/memory on DART-relevant workloads. If DART cannot beat
  foonathan/memory for required features and workloads, prefer an explicit
  dependency decision over shipping a weaker in-house allocator.

## Required Allocator Evidence

- Correctness tests: alignment (including over-aligned Eigen-like types),
  zero-size behavior, reuse-after-free, double-free/leak debug paths, frame
  reset semantics, overflow/growth accounting, deterministic failure handling
  for bounded/static storage, and multi-world isolation.
- Benchmarks: allocation/deallocation latency, container workloads, per-frame
  arena reset, pool reuse under churn, mixed-size free-list fragmentation,
  multibody/contact/deformable step-loop scratch patterns, and no-growth
  baked-world repeated simulation loops.
- Comparison targets: `std::allocator`/`std::pmr` where applicable, current
  DART allocators, improved DART allocators, and foonathan/memory's relevant
  raw allocators, pools, static storage, temporary allocator, adapters, and
  tracking/debug wrappers.

## Required EnTT Integration Evidence

- Registry construction: prove whether the active EnTT version can use a
  stateful allocator through `entt::basic_registry` and component
  `basic_storage`, or document the exact adapter/storage work needed.
- Component storage: cover create/emplace/destroy/clear/reuse patterns for the
  current experimental components, including sparse-set growth and component
  array capacity behavior.
- Bake/build reserve path: reserve registry entities and component pools before
  simulation so repeated `World::step()` calls do not grow ECS storage.
- Boundary rule: keep EnTT allocator/storage types out of the promoted public
  facade; expose only DART-owned memory options and diagnostics.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Add allocator correctness tests and benchmark coverage for DART allocators
   against `std::allocator`/`std::pmr` and foonathan/memory.
2. Add bake-time registry/component storage reservation and no-growth ECS tests
   before claiming zero allocations for ECS-backed world data.
3. Benchmark the allocator-backed EnTT registry/component-storage path against
   standard C++ allocators and foonathan/memory on DART-relevant workloads.
4. Start replacing per-step `std::vector`/`Eigen` temporaries in hot stages with
   world-frame or world-pool backed storage only after the allocator evidence
   gate proves the DART allocator path is better for that workload.
