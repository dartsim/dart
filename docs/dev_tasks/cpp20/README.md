# C++20 Modernization - Dev Task

## Status

- Phase 3 in progress: additive public header updates underway.

## Goal

Modernize the codebase to idiomatic C++20 while preserving behavior and public
APIs.

## Non-goals

- Behavior changes or algorithmic refactors
- Public API or ABI breaks
- New dependencies or build entry points

## Constraints

- Use existing tooling (`pixi run ...`) and follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Keep changes mechanical and reviewable; prefer internal-only refactors.
- Update progress and plan docs after each phase.

## Documents

- Plan: `docs/dev_tasks/cpp20/00_plan.md`
- Progress: `docs/dev_tasks/cpp20/01_progress.md`
- Resume prompt: `docs/dev_tasks/cpp20/resume_prompt.md`
