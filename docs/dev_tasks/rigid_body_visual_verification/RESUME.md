# Resume: Rigid Body Visual Verification

## Current Handoff (2026-06-12)

This checkpoint completes the rigid IPC edge-drop related-evidence slice that
was left uncommitted in the previous stop-state hand-off.

Expected repository state after this hand-off:

- Branch: `feature/rigid-body-gui-visual-verification`.
- After commit, the branch is expected to be one local commit ahead of origin
  unless a future session has pushed it:
  - `Promote rigid IPC edge drop evidence`.
- There is no PR associated with this branch at checkpoint time.
- The latest checkpoint is local only and should not be pushed without explicit
  maintainer/user approval in the next active session.
- Before any future commit, rerun the repository-mandated `pixi run lint`.

## Last Session Summary

The previous implementation session fixed `py-demos --cycle-scenes` so a
bounded `--frames N` value applies to every scene instead of ending the whole
catalog after the first frame. It updated tests and docs, validated the full
151-scene headless cycle command, and committed the change locally as
`0e38e3e807d Fix py-demos cycle scene frame budget`.

The latest session added uncommitted work for two user-facing rigid workflow
gaps: broader in-viewer search aliases for DART 7 solver/backend/contact terms,
and `py-demo-capture -- --rigid-workflow` for planning or running all numbered
rigid captures into a workflow-level manifest. Focused tests and the public
dry-run command passed, and the full 36-scene workflow capture later completed
successfully under `/tmp/dart_capture_rigid_workflow_full_1781257174`.
After that full capture, the capture helper was adjusted to flush workflow
progress and isolate each per-scene capture in a child process. The user then
requested handoff-only work and no further verification.

The current continuation inspected the uncommitted workflow diff, fixed a
missing-evidence bug where a child process could exit 0 without writing its
per-scene manifest, and added a regression so that case fails the top-level
workflow manifest. Focused tests, public dry-run, lint, and `git diff --check`
passed after the fix.

The latest continuation added two more user-facing GUI improvements: the
`Rigid Workflow` panel now shows each row's exact `py-demo-capture` command,
and adjacent parameter/profiling rows now label their comparison axis plus
held-fixed controls in both panels and capture metrics. Focused pytest,
the public workflow dry-run, lint, and `git diff --check` passed.

The current continuation adds the next workflow review surface:
`py-demo-capture -- --rigid-workflow` now rewrites a top-level
`review_index.html` contact sheet on dry-run, progress updates, failure, and
completion. The contact sheet links every numbered row's manifest, screenshot,
frame directory, command, and comparison/metrics summary so reviewers can scan
all 36 outputs without opening per-scene folders manually. Focused pytest,
public dry-run, lint, and `git diff --check` passed; the dry-run manifest
recorded `artifacts.review_index`, `capture_count=36`, and `status=planned`.
The latest continuation then ran the slow full workflow capture with the review
index enabled. It completed all 36 numbered rows under
`/tmp/dart_capture_rigid_workflow_full_review_index_1781259714`; the top-level
manifest reported `status=complete`, `completed_count=36`, `failed_count=0`,
and `elapsed_s=314.278`, and the generated `review_index.html` contained
36 screenshot thumbnails plus comparison/metric summaries.
The verified rigid workflow search/capture/review-index slice was then
committed and pushed as
`e8278b6fb53 Improve rigid workflow capture evidence`.

The current continuation makes one focused viewer-routing improvement:
related-evidence `Find row` matches such as `avbd prismatic` now open the
matched non-numbered shelf scene directly instead of landing on the numbered
source row first.

The newest continuation adds an opt-in related-evidence capture bundle:
`py-demo-capture -- --rigid-workflow --include-related` appends the ten
non-numbered related shelf routes after the 36 numbered rows and records them
in the same manifest/review index with `workflow_group=related_evidence`.

The latest continuation adds a second opt-in bundle:
`py-demo-capture -- --rigid-workflow --include-packets` appends the
capture-first `rigid_ipc_stack_packet` after the numbered rows and optional
related-evidence routes with `workflow_group=capture_first_packet`.

The current continuation adds workflow row-range selection:
`py-demo-capture -- --rigid-workflow --workflow-start-row N --workflow-end-row M`
captures or dry-runs only the selected absolute workflow rows while keeping
their original row labels and `scenes/NN_<scene>` output directories.

The latest continuation enriches the generated workflow evidence packet:
numbered rigid workflow entries now carry the same row guidance as the
in-viewer `Rigid Workflow` panel, including role label, user question,
try-first action, inspect signals, healthy signal, and scope note in both the
manifest and `review_index.html`.

The current continuation promotes `rigid_ipc_edge_drop` into a self-describing
related-evidence route from `rigid_solver_compare`, with a panel and capture
metrics for degenerate edge-barrier gap, tilt, angular speed, contact count,
step timing, and status. The scene intentionally remains outside the numbered
36-row World Rigid Body workflow because it is an IPC-specific capability view.

## Current Branch

`feature/rigid-body-gui-visual-verification`

Current snapshot:

- At the start of the current continuation, clean and aligned with
  `origin/feature/rigid-body-gui-visual-verification`.
- Latest pushed commits:
  `0e38e3e807d Fix py-demos cycle scene frame budget`.
  `e8278b6fb53 Improve rigid workflow capture evidence`.
- At the start of this continuation, the branch was aligned with
  `origin/feature/rigid-body-gui-visual-verification` at
  `226a5b99de9 Refresh rigid visual verification handoff`.
- Current branch is expected to be one local commit ahead of origin after this
  checkpoint: `Promote rigid IPC edge drop evidence`.
- The latest checkpoint is local only and should not be pushed without explicit
  maintainer/user approval in the next active session.

## Immediate Next Step

Inspect `git status -sb` first. Expect one local commit ahead of origin unless a
future session has already pushed it. Do not push without explicit approval in
that session, and rerun `pixi run lint` before committing further changes.

## Context That Would Be Lost

- The task goal is not just to add examples; it is to make rigid-body GUI demos
  useful as visual debugging and verification surfaces for solvers, backends,
  parameters, contact behavior, constraints, and corner cases.
- Durable planning context lives in
  `docs/plans/103-examples-strategy/rigid-body-visual-verification.md`.
- That sidecar already documents the 36 rigid workflow rows and current API
  limitations.
- Public `dartpy` is currently believed to lack direct rigid-body impulse,
  sleep/wake/island activation, and loop-compliance APIs. Do not build rows
  around those features without first confirming the API surface changed.
- A read-only explorer subagent was spawned before the stop instruction, but
  the stop instruction superseded waiting for or consuming its result. It later
  returned and identified the workflow-level capture command as the highest
  value bounded follow-up.
- A second read-only explorer identified missing search terms such as
  `RigidBodySolver`, `ContactSolverMethod`, `backend/executor`, and
  `contact model`; those terms are now covered by the workflow search aliases.
- The previous cycle fix changed C++ GUI runner behavior, Python integration
  tests, and docs. It was validated before the stop request, not after.
- The full workflow capture command completed all 36 numbered rigid captures.
  Its top-level manifest reported `status=complete`, `capture_count=36`,
  `completed_count=36`, `failed_count=0`, and all 36 per-scene manifests
  existed.
- The full run exposed parent progress buffering; `scripts/capture_py_demo.py`
  now flushes workflow progress and manifest lines.
- The workflow runner now treats a missing per-scene manifest as
  `failure_reason: missing_manifest` and exits nonzero, even if the child
  process returned 0.
- The in-viewer workflow panel now closes the loop from interactive debugging
  to reproducible visual evidence by printing the row-specific capture command.
- The comparison-contract labels intentionally separate solver family,
  executor-only, contact policy, time-step multiplier, workload shape/contact
  workload, and passive joint parameter family axes so users do not conflate
  backend, solver, policy, and parameter changes.
- The workflow review index is intentionally generated beside the manifest,
  not checked in. `manifest.json` records it under `artifacts.review_index`.
- The related-evidence bundle is intentionally opt-in so default
  `--rigid-workflow` still captures exactly the 36 numbered rows. The
  `--include-related` variant appends the related routes as rows 37-46 in the
  generated review packet.
- The capture-first packet bundle is also opt-in. `--include-packets` appends
  `rigid_ipc_stack_packet` after the numbered rows and, when present, after the
  related-evidence rows.
- Row-range selection is intended for targeted reruns after a long workflow
  packet fails or needs manual inspection. It keeps absolute row labels and
  output directories, so selected packet row 47 appears as `47/47` and writes to
  `scenes/47_rigid_ipc_stack_packet`.
- The review index now mirrors the numbered rows' in-viewer guidance so the
  capture packet answers "what am I looking at?" without opening the live GUI
  or sidecar table.
- `rigid_ipc_edge_drop` stays outside the numbered World Rigid Body workflow;
  it is an IPC-specific related capability scene, not a new row in the 36-row
  workflow.
