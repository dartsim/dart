\section{Overview}
The following document describes the construction of the matrices responsible for solving LCP (linear-complimentarity problems) for articulated rigid bodies in generalized coordinates. The document assumes familiarity with the mathematical construction of LCP. This was originally intended as a guide for the implementation of the LCP solver for the DART dynamics library.
