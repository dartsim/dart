Tutorials
=========

The dartpy tutorials mirror the structure of the C++ guides while pointing to
the python implementations. Each page explains how to run the tutorial, where
the starter/finished code is located, and how the lessons map onto the python
APIs.

The dartpy and C++ tutorials now share a single set of documents. Visit
:doc:`../../tutorials/index` to choose a lesson and then toggle the code snippets
to the language you prefer.
