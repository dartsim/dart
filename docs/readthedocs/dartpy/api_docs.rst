API Documentation
=================

The in-depth API documentation playbook now lives in the developer onboarding guide:

* `docs/onboarding/api-documentation.md <https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/main/docs/onboarding/api-documentation.md>`_

That document covers how Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, and the CI pipeline work together, including local build commands, automation, and troubleshooting tips.

For quick access to the published API reference, use the links on the :doc:`../dart/cpp_api_reference` and :doc:`python_api_reference` pages.
