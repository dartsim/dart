Welcome to DART 7's documentation!
==================================

Introduction
------------

DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative,
cross-platform, open-source library developed by the
`Graphics Lab <http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~karenliu/Home.html>`_ and
`Humanoid Robotics Lab <http://www.golems.org/>`_ at the
`Georgia Institute of Technology <http://www.gatech.edu/>`_, with ongoing
contributions from the
`Personal Robotics Lab <http://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/>`_ at the
`University of Washington <http://www.washington.edu/>`_ and the
`Open Source Robotics Foundation <https://www.osrfoundation.org/>`_. It provides
data structures and algorithms for kinematic and dynamic applications in
robotics and computer animation. DART stands out due to its accuracy and
stability, which are achieved through the use of generalized coordinates to
represent articulated rigid body systems and the application of Featherstone's
Articulated Body Algorithm to compute motion dynamics.

.. note::
   This document pertains to the new major version, DART 7, which is currently
   under heavy development. Please note that this early stage version may
   contain bugs or other issues. If you prefer to use a more stable version,
   please use DART 6.13 instead.

Vision for DART 7
-----------------

* Elevate the Python binding to a first-class component, ensuring full support
  and equivalent functionality to the C++ APIs, rather than remaining in an
  experimental stage.
* Modularize the library so that users can select specific components to use
  with minimal required dependencies, rather than having to use the entire
  library, including unnecessary parts.
* Utilize hardware accelerations, such as SIMD, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs,
  whenever available and enabled by the user, to maximize overall performance.
* Support both single and double precision, with options to compile the library
  for required scalar types or leave the template code uncompiled.
* Minimize dependencies to make the library usable without bringing in all
  transitive dependencies.
* Modernize implementation and public APIs to enable users to work with more
  intuitive and user-friendly APIs.
* Provide various resources, such as a quick start guide, examples, and
  tutorials, to lower the initial learning curve for users.
