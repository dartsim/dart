Tutorials
=========

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a quick introduction to
using DART. We designed many hands-on exercises to make the learning
effective and fun. To follow along with this tutorial, first locate
the tutorial code in the directory:
`dart/tutorials <https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials>`_.
For each of the four tutorials, we provide the skeleton code as the starting
point (e.g.
`tutorial_multi_pendulum <https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials/tutorial_multi_pendulum>`_)
and the final code as the answer to the tutorial (e.g.
`tutorial_multi_pendulum_finished <https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials/tutorial_multi_pendulum_finished>`_).
The examples are based on the APIs of DART 7.0.
