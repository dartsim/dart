"The reason for using different naming conventions in the C++ code and the"

"By using the standard naming conventions in each language, we can make "
"the code more readable and easier to understand for developers who are "
"familiar with each language. Consistency within each language is "
"important, but it's also crucial to document the conventions clearly so "
"that other developers can understand how to use the code and what the "
"naming conventions mean in each context. Additionally, following the "
"naming conventions of each language can help with integration with other "
"Python modules or projects."
