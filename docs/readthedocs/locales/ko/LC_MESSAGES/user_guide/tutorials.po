"The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a quick introduction to using "
"DART. We designed many hands-on exercises to make the learning effective "
"and fun. To follow along with this tutorial, first locate the tutorial "
"code in the directory: `dart/tutorials "
"<https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials>`_."
" For each of the four tutorials, we provide the skeleton code as the "
"starting point (e.g. `tutorial_multi_pendulum "
"<https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials/tutorial_multi_pendulum>`_)"
" and the final code as the answer to the tutorial (e.g. "
"`tutorial_multi_pendulum_finished "
"<https://github.com/dartsim/dart/tree/2b59bd7b4ab7ea184026d5a19f1ad20df867012d/tutorials/tutorial_multi_pendulum_finished>`_)."
" The examples are based on the APIs of DART 7.0."
