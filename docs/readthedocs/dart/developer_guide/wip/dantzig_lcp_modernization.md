# Dantzig LCP Solver Modernization Plan

**Status:** Work In Progress
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
**Assignee:** TBD

## Context & Resume Prompt

```
I am working on modernizing the Dantzig LCP solver in the DART project located at dart/lcpsolver/dantzig/.
This code was originally copied from dart/external/odelcpsolver/. The goal is to modernize it while maintaining
correctness and improving performance. Please continue with the next pending task from the plan document at
docs/readthedocs/dart/developer_guide/wip/dantzig_lcp_modernization.md.
```

## Overview

The Dantzig LCP solver in `dart/lcpsolver/dantzig/` is a critical component for constraint solving in DART's
physics engine. It was originally copied from the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) implementation at
`dart/external/odelcpsolver/`. This plan outlines a comprehensive modernization effort to improve code quality,
performance, and maintainability while ensuring correctness through rigorous testing.

## Goals

1. **Establish Baseline**: Move ODE reference implementation to a baseline testing directory
2. **Validate Correctness**: Create comprehensive tests to verify behavior matches ODE implementation
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish performance baselines and track improvements
4. **Namespace Migration**: Remove ODE namespace, adopt dart::lcpsolver namespace
5. **Modernization (Phased)**:
   - Phase A: STL libraries (vectors, algorithms, etc.) - no performance degradation
   - Phase B: Eigen library integration for matrix operations
   - Phase C: DrJit C++ library for CPU architecture-agnostic SIMD operations
6. **Code Style**: Update to match DART codebase conventions

- Replace manual memory management with RAII
- Use std::unique_ptr/std::shared_ptr where appropriate
- Modern for loops (range-based) where clearer

**Files to modify:**
- All files in `dart/lcpsolver/dantzig/`

**Benchmarking:**
- Run benchmarks before and after each change

- No raw new/delete for memory management
- Tests pass
- Performance â‰¥95% of baseline

### 5. Phase B: Eigen Integration (Week 4)

**Status:** Pending

- Tests pass
- Performance â‰¥100% of baseline (hopefully better)

### 6. Phase C: DrJit SIMD (Future - Week 5+)

**Status:** Future Work

**Research needed:**
- DrJit compatibility with DART's build system
- Performance gains vs complexity
- Maintenance burden

**Tasks:**
- Evaluate DrJit library integration
- Proof of concept on critical paths
- Performance comparison
- Decision: integrate or defer

### 7. Code Style Updates (Throughout)

**Status:** Ongoing

**Guidelines:**
- Follow DART naming conventions:
  - Functions: camelCase
  - Classes: PascalCase
  - Private members: mMemberName
  - Constants: kConstantName
- Use DART's formatting (run clang-format)
- Add Doxygen comments
- Use const correctness
- Prefer auto where type is obvious

**Files to modify:**
- All files in `dart/lcpsolver/dantzig/`

**Success criteria:**
- Code passes DART's linter/formatter
- Consistent with DART codebase style
- Well-documented with Doxygen comments

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Location: `tests/unit/lcpsolver/`
- Coverage: >90% line coverage
- Validation: Compare against ODE baseline
- Edge cases: Singular, infeasible, degenerate problems

### Benchmark Tests
- Location: `tests/benchmark/lcpsolver/`
- Track: Time, iterations, solution quality
- Compare: dart::lcpsolver vs ODE baseline
- Sizes: 1D, 2D, 4D, 6D, 12D, 24D, 48D

### Integration Tests
- Use in realistic robot simulation scenarios
- Verify no regression in existing DART examples
- Performance in end-to-end workflows

## Performance Metrics

### Baseline (ODE Implementation)
To be measured and documented in Phase 1.

### Target Performance
- Phase A (STL): â‰¥95% of baseline
- Phase B (Eigen): â‰¥100% of baseline (aiming for improvement)
- Phase C (DrJit): â‰¥110% of baseline (goal)

## Risk Management

### Risks & Mitigation

1. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking, rollback threshold
   - Each change validated before proceeding

2. **Correctness Issues**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests vs ODE baseline
   - Numerical tolerance validation

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach, incremental changes
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

4. **Time/Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Clear phase boundaries
   - Phase C (DrJit) is optional/future work

## Documentation Updates

As implementation progresses, update:
- This plan document (keep in sync!)
- API documentation (Doxygen comments)
- User-facing documentation if API changes
- Performance benchmarks and results
- Migration guide if needed

## Review & Sign-off

Each phase requires:
1. Code review
2. Test coverage verification
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Documentation updates
5. Sign-off before next phase

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Baseline setup, initial benchmarks
- **Week 2**: Validation tests, namespace migration
- **Week 3**: Phase A (STL modernization)
- **Week 4**: Phase B (Eigen integration)
- **Week 5+**: Phase C evaluation (optional/future)

**Note**: Timeline is flexible based on complexity and performance validation.
