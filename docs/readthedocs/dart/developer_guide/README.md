# Developer Guide Moved

The DART developer documentation has been consolidated and moved to provide better organization and discoverability.

## New Location

**All developer documentation is now in:** `docs/onboarding/`

This includes:
- Build instructions
- Contribution guidelines
- Code style guide
- Architecture documentation
- And more...

## Quick Links

- **Main onboarding guide:** [docs/onboarding/README.md](../../onboarding/README.md)
- **Building from source:** [docs/onboarding/building.md](../../onboarding/building.md)
- **Contributing:** [docs/onboarding/contributing.md](../../onboarding/contributing.md)
- **Code style:** [docs/onboarding/code-style.md](../../onboarding/code-style.md)

## Why the Change?

The documentation has been reorganized to:
- **Single source of truth**: All developer docs in one location
- **Better for LLMs**: Markdown format in GitHub-native structure
- **Easier maintenance**: No duplication between CONTRIBUTING.md and readthedocs
- **Clear separation**: User docs (readthedocs) vs developer docs (onboarding)

## User Documentation

For end-user documentation (installation guides, tutorials, API reference), see:
- [docs/readthedocs/dart/user_guide/](../user_guide/)
- [https://dart.readthedocs.io/](https://dart.readthedocs.io/)
