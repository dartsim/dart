Tutorials
=========

These guides provide a hands-on introduction to DART's core APIs. Each tutorial
presents the same lesson in C++ and dartpy so you can follow along in your
preferred language. The companion source lives in the repository:

- C++: ``tutorials/tutorial_*`` and ``tutorials/tutorial_*_finished``
- Python: ``python/tutorials/*``

Clone the repo and build the samples (``pixi run build`` / ``pixi run build-py``)
to experiment with the exercises referenced from every page.
