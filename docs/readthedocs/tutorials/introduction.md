The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a quick introduction to
using DART. We designed many hands-on exercises to make the learning
effective and fun. To follow along with this tutorial, first locate
the tutorial code in the directory: dart/tutorials. For each of the
four tutorials, we provide the skeleton code as the starting point
(e.g. tutorialMultiPendulum.cpp) and
the final code as the answer to the tutorial (e.g. tutorialMultiPendulum-Finished.cpp). The examples are based on the APIs of DART 5.0.
