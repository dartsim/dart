## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:

1. **Development environment set up**: See [building.md](building.md)
2. **Understanding of DART architecture**: Read [README.md](README.md)
3. **Familiarity with code style**: Check [code-style.md](code-style.md)

### Finding Something to Work On

- **Browse Issues**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/issues) for open bugs or feature requests
- **Good First Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for newcomers
- **Feature Requests**: Check [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/discussions) for feature ideas
- **Documentation**: Improving docs is always appreciated!

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dart.git
cd dart

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dartsim/dart.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write code following the [code style guide](code-style.md)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Commit with clear, descriptive messages

### 4. Build and Test

```bash
# Using pixi (recommended)
pixi run build
pixi run test

# Or manually
cmake --build build/
cmake --build build/ --target test
```

### 5. Format Your Code

```bash
# Using pixi
pixi run format

# Or manually
cd build/
make format
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

## Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

### Unit Tests

- Located in `tests/unit/`
- Use Google Test framework
- Run with: `pixi run test` or `cmake --build build/ --target test`

### Integration Tests

- Located in `tests/integration/`
- Test interactions between components
- Include in PR description

### Python Tests

If modifying Python bindings:

```bash
# Run Python tests
pixi run test-py

# Or manually
python -m pytest python/tests/
```

### Coverage

Check test coverage:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pixi run coverage-view

# Or manually
cmake --build build/ --target coverage_view
```

## Code Review Process

### Submitting a Pull Request

Your PR description should include:

1. **Summary**: What does this PR do?
2. **Motivation**: Why is this change needed?
3. **Changes**: List of key changes
4. **Testing**: How was this tested?
5. **Breaking Changes**: Any API changes?
6. **Related Issues**: Link to relevant issues

### Review Checklist

Reviewers will check:

- [ ] Code follows [style guide](code-style.md)
- [ ] Tests are included and pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No unnecessary changes (keep PRs focused)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] No merge conflicts

### Addressing Feedback

- Be responsive to reviewer comments
- Make requested changes in new commits (don't force-push)
- Mark conversations as resolved when addressed
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear

### Merging

- PRs are typically merged by maintainers
- Squash merging is used for clean history
- Your contribution will be acknowledged!

## Release Process

DART follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

Releases are managed by project maintainers. Contributors don't need to worry about versioning.
