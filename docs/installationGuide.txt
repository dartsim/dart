Installation Guide

1. Setup CMake
Download CMake packages from http://www.cmake.org/.
Use CMake to generate the solution files (Visual Studio) or Makefile (Unix-like system).
You can use either command line or gui.

Ex)
In Windows, run the CMake application. 
Select CMakeLists.txt at root ("groundzero/").
Make the system to generate the solution files under "groundzero/msvc/".

Ex)
In Unix-Like systems, go to "groundzero/bin/" directory and type the following command.
cmake ..

2. Setup third party libraries
We have dependencies on several third party libraries, including
FreeImage, eigen, gflags, glog, gtest, glut, ticpp, and snopt. The
source code of these libraries can be found under "groundzero/thirdparty". 
Compile all the libraries, and put the generated library files under "groundzero/thirdparty/lib".
(Note: If using Windows, remember to compile all projects with the same compiler (i.e. using the same version of Visual Studio).)

2.1 Snopt package 
In Unix-like systems, you can just use Makefile to compile the snopt package. (Requires gfortran.)

In Windows, you can use Visual Fortran (Intel Composer XE, http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-composer-xe/) to compile the package.
You can compile the library with the trial version.

3. Use generated Makefile or Visual Studio Solution file to compile the entire groundzero package.
