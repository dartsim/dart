1. Setup CMake
Download CMake packages from http://www.cmake.org/.
Use CMake to generate the solution files (Visual Studio) or Makefile (Unix-like system).
You can use either command line or gui.

Ex)
In Windows,
Use GUI. select CMakeLists.txt at root ("groundzero/")
Make the system to generate the solution files under "groundzero/msvc/".

Ex)
In Unix-Like system, go to "groundzero/bin/" directory and type the following command.
cmake ..

2. Setup third party libraries
We have dependancis on several third party libraries.
Compile all the libraries, and put the generated library files under "groundzero/thirdparty/lib".

2.1 Snopt package 
In Unix-like system, you can just use Makefile to compile the snopt package. (requires gfortran)

In Windows, you can use Visual Fortran (Intel Composer XE, http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-composer-xe/) to compile the package.
You can compile the library with the trial version.


3. Use generated Makefile or Visual Studio Solution file to compile the entire groundzero package.
